This included a request to search the boy and a report from another child who said the boy had shown him a gun. The teacher - Abigail Zwerner, 25 - is recovering after being released from hospital last week. In the fallout, the school's superintendent has now lost his job. Board members of Richneck Elementary School voted five-to-one to sack George Parker.  The removal of Mr Parker happened only hours after Ms Zwerner's lawyer, Diane Toscano, announced plans to sue the district, saying the shooting was ""entirely preventable"".  Police have not announced any charges. The 6 January shooting - which authorities have described as ""intentional"" - rocked the Virginia city of Newport News, and raised questions about what legal consequences may follow and for whom.  ""On that day, over the course of a few hours, three different times - three times - school administration was warned by concerned teachers and employees that the boy had a gun on him at school and was threatening people,"" said Ms Toscano.  ""But the administration could not be bothered."" According to Ms Toscano: At around 14:00 the boy pointed the gun at Ms Zwerner and fired in the middle of a lesson, police said. Newport News police chief Steve Drew has said Ms Zwerner saved lives by ushering her students out of the class after being shot through the hand and in the chest.  Newport News Mayor Phillip Jones thanked the outgoing superintendent, and said he supports the board's effort to ""hire a dynamic, new leader for our public school system - one that will help us heal and move forward with the necessary changes to make our schools safer for everyone"". The superintendent's salary was over $250,000 (Â£200,000) per year, according to local news outlets. He will continue to receive full salary and benefits until June 2024 because he was fired ""without cause"".  As well as the departure of the superintendent, the assistant principal of Richneck Elementary School is also leaving his post after resigning. Ms Toscano's claims are bolstered by text messages exchanged between the school's teachers and obtained by the Washington Post. According to the messages, Ms Zwerner had raised concerns about the six-year-old and asked for help.  Last week, the family of the young boy said he suffered from an ""acute disability"" and rarely attended school without one of his parents being present. The day of the shooting he had attended school alone.  The family also praised Ms Zwerner, saying she had ""worked diligently and compassionately to support our family as we sought the best education and learning environment for our son"". Police said the gun used by the boy had been legally purchased by his mother. The boy's family said the weapon had been ""secured"". Police have not responded to this claim.  Virginia law prohibits anyone from recklessly leaving a loaded, unsecured firearm in such a way that may endanger a child under 14 years of age.

1,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,Joshimath: What’s the future of India's sinking Himalayan town?,Experts say it will be hard to save parts of the town that are already sinking.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64369752,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/61C5/production/_128392052_mediaitem128392051.jpg,2023-01-24T01:40:14Z,"Hundreds of people have been evacuated from Joshimath, a Himalayan town which has been slowly sinking into the ground in India. As residents waited in uncertainty, the BBC's Vineet Khare spoke to experts to understand if the town could be saved. Pushkar Singh Dhami, chief minister of Uttarakhand state where Joshimath is located, said that around 25% of the town's area had been affected by the subsidence.  Joshimath, with 25,000 residents, has around 4,500 buildings spread over 2.5 sq km (0.96 sq miles). More than 800 buildings have developed cracks, and authorities have been demolishing the unsafe ones. ""It doesn't look like the subsiding areas of Joshimath - which comprise settlements, houses and constructions - will survive,"" says geologist Dr SP Sati. ""There are no obstacles down the slope to prevent the subsidence, and there should have been multiple obstacles,"" he says, referring to the lack of green cover in the area. Joshimath was built on the debris of a landslide triggered by an earthquake, and is located in a tremor-prone zone. It frequently witnesses landslides, which have weakened the soil. The subsidence will continue until a new lower level is reached, warns CP Rajendran, a geoscientist and adjunct professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies. ""It will stabilise eventually, but by then many of the buildings will get damaged,"" he says. Residents are also worried that rain or snow in the days and weeks ahead could worsen the situation. Experts say the present crisis has been caused by several factors including years of unplanned construction, hydropower projects and the lack of a proper drainage system. Back in 1976, a government report had mooted restrictions on heavy construction work in Joshimath, saying that it should only be allowed after examining the ""load-bearing capacity of the soil"". The report had also suggested constructing proper drainage and sewage systems, and installing concrete cement blocks to check erosion. Last year, a report by a government panel echoed many of these recommendations, including building a ""well-planned drainage system"".  But activists have long complained that these haven't been implemented. Local anger is directed at a top Indian power company, the government-owned NTPC Ltd, whose ongoing Tapovan Vishnugad hydro power project, they allege, is tunnelling through the fragile ecosystem. ""The company is responsible for the damage to the historic, cultural town of Joshimath, and it should compensate residents,"" says Atul Sati, the convenor of a group who has been holding protests to save the town. NTPC has denied the allegations. In a statement, it said its tunnel does not pass under the town and that it is at a ""horizontal distance of over a kilometre from the outer boundary of Joshimath town"".  Federal power minister RK Singh has dismissed links between the power plant and the town's condition. ""Nothing happened to the village nearby and the villages above the project, and nothing happened to all the villages in that 15km stretch,"" he said in a recent interview. The federal government's high-profile Char Dham road project, which aims to widen existing roads connecting four Hindu pilgrimage sites, has also drawn criticism. Work on a bypass road that would have passed through Joshimath has been stopped after protests.   ""You cannot have a freeway like the Autobahn [Germany's federal highway system] in Europe built in the Himalayas,"" Mr Rajendran says. Administrators say these allegations could impact ""the inflow of tourists"" to the area and damage the local economy. ""We should ground our claims in science,"" says Himanshu Khurana, the magistrate of Chamoli district, where Joshimath is located. ""The Himalayas are there in China, Nepal, in Pakistan, spread across so many states in India. Why only target Uttarakhand?"" asks R Meenakshi Sundaram, secretary to Uttarakhand's chief minister. ""If the Himalayas are fragile, no development activity should take place in any of these countries and in other states,"" he adds.  Some have also advised caution while deciding the future of the town, which is close to India's border with China. Dr Suvrokamal Dutta, an economic and foreign policy expert allied with the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, says that stopping development activity in border areas ""would be a very cynical and strategically disastrous thing to do, taking into account India's security and strategic concerns due to the China factor"". Some experts still believe the situation is salvageable. Dr Swapnamita Vaideswaran, a geologist at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, says that the immediate need is to rehabilitate the worst-affected people. In the long term, she says, there will need to be ""a new planned town"" which has stricter building rules. Others disagree. ""This valley seems to be more unstable, more unreliable for human living and construction than your average Himalayan valley,"" says Dr Jeffrey S. Kargel, senior geologist at Planetary Science Institute in the US. ""It should be a national park. Let people come in for short periods of time to enjoy nature and get out,"" he suggests. He refers to a ""similar cracking"" that occurred near the Pakistani town of Aliabad in 2010. A landslide caused debris to block the river Hunza, which in turn prevented water from flowing downstream and created what is now referred to as the Attabad lake.  The BBC reported that thousands had been displaced by the rising water levels in Attabad. The site is now a tourist spot. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

A viral post falsely claimed the climate activist being held by police was ""all set up for the cameras"". Ms Thunberg and other activists were seeking to stop the abandoned village of LÃ¼tzerath from being demolished for the expansion of a coal mine. The video of her being removed by police has gained millions of views. ""We would never give ourselves to make such recordings,"" a spokesperson for local police told the BBC, denying allegations that Ms Thunberg's detainment was fake. But it is important that the police enable reporting and guarantee the protection of media workers, they added.  The viral video shows the climate campaigner flanked by police officers on either side. Meanwhile a few photographers can be seen snapping photos and moving around her, as Ms Thunberg smiles. Several other police officers who were also standing nearby appear to be waiting with her before walking her away from the scene. Some online have jumped onto these moments of officers and Ms Thunberg waiting around, to falsely claim that it is part of a staged photo opportunity. However the interior ministry of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia told the BBC that the police officers and Ms Thunberg were waiting for logistical reasons.  ""They had to wait for a couple of minutes before they could bring her to a certain police car,"" said the spokesperson. They added that ""the whole situation has been used by those with political motives and the real reason is entirely practical and mundane.""  Christian Wernicke, a journalist from German news outlet SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung who was there at the time, said the police officers ""were deciding how they would proceed with the identity check and waiting to take Greta to the police vehicle."" ""My impression was that there was confusion. Greta was not the first protester who had been taken away from the sit-in,"" Mr Wernicke added. ""I've seen different reactions to the video. Some say that the footage looks like the police are setting her up to embarrass her and others say that it is all part of some propaganda. ""People are interpreting and using this footage for their own motives."" Many online also falsely claimed it was a ""fake arrest"" but police clarified that Ms Thunberg had not been arrested but had been briefly detained.  The group of activists were detained after they ""rushed towards the ledge"" of the Garzweiler 2 mine, police had said on Tuesday. Officers also confirmed all of those detained would not be charged. Ms Thunberg has frequently been the target of conspiracy theories and false claims online, often by those who deny the existence of man-made climate change. She tweeted: ""Yesterday I was part of a group that peacefully protested the expansion of a coal mine in Germany. We were kettled by police and then detained but were let go later that evening.

The BBC's Imran Qureshi finds out how the Ukraine war shaped their journey. A year ago, Chandra Mohan, an Indian living in Poland, found himself in a crisis when he was saddled with 20,000 kg (44,092 lb) of rice flakes that a business client didn't want to pick it up. The rice flakes, supplied by a firm based in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, were being imported by a local businessman to make cereals.  The war in Ukraine had just begun. Four days before the ship carrying the consignment was due at the port in Poland, Mr Mohan's client got cold feet as the exchange rate fluctuated. The client wanted the Indo-Polish Chamber of Commerce, where Chandra Mohan was head of business relations, to come up with a solution to use the shipment he could no longer afford.  Mr Mohan bought the flakes and along with his designer friend Sargheve Sukumaran hit up on an idea of making a beer. ""Chandran said, 'I am thinking of a beer called Malayali,'"" Mr Sukumaran recounts.   Both men hail from the southern Indian state of Kerala, whose natives are called Malayalis after their mother tongue, Malayalam.  ""I was also interested in creating a product that was rooted in our history - in Kerala and Indian traditions - but appealed to a global audience,"" Mr Sukumaran says.  Both men were clear that the beer needed to use the rice flakes but should not be ""a rice-y beer"".   The idea wasn't entirely new. ""There is already Japanese beer that is made of rice with Japanese hops,"" Mr Mohan says. The idea was to distinguish their product by having rice flavour beer with European hops. Mr Mohan and Mr Sukumaran turned to another Malayali for advice.  Lijo Phillip had launched his own beer brand - Kalikut 1498 - in Poland before the pandemic. Kalikut is another way of spelling Calicut (now called Kozhikode) - a district in Kerala.  With his guidance, Mr Mohan and Mr Sukumaran worked on producing their own beer.   ""In Poland, you have a lot of beers coming in from other European countries, particularly the good ones from Belgium,"" Mr Sukumaran says.  But none of these used rice. Mr Mohan is a teetotaller, so Mr Sukumaran took on the task of tasting and testing products.  ""We tried a few times and succeeded on our third try in getting the perfect balance,"" he says.   This video can not be played Bira 91 has become a popular beer brand across India The challenge was now to produce the beer on a large scale.  They two got into an arrangement with a brewery which insisted on taking a boiler on rent with a minimum order. This meant they had to get restaurants on board to serve their beer.  But they decided on a name for the drink. Mr Mohan had been also leading a team of expats which was helping Indians who had fled Ukraine after the war.  ""Most of the volunteers were from Kerala,"" he says. ""And I realised that being Malayali was an emotion [that connected us].""  It inspired the partners to name their drink 'Malayali beer'.   The cultural identity also infused their design of the brand.  Mr Sukumaran designed the label around the headgear worn by artists who perform Kathakali - a traditional dance form from Kerala. He then combined this with the state's love for films by using aviator sunglasses and the moustache of acting legend Mohanlal.   To sustain the business, the two offered a made-to-order bottling service for wedding planners. It was a hit, particularly among Indian immigrants marrying Polish citizens. Now, Malayali Spirits - the company set up by him and Mr Sukumaran - has a contract with a distributor for Indian and Asian grocery stores to supply 2,400 litres (5,074 pints) of beer every two months.  The company claims it has sold over 50,000 bottles of beer so far and plans to increase production soon.  ""We now have several enquiries from other European nations and the US,"" Mr Mohan says.

The cause is ""Skyglow"" from artificial lighting - the brightness of that glow has increased every year since 2011. Dr Christopher Kyba, a scientist from the German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, told the BBC: ""Our view of the stars is disappearing"".  He and his colleagues published this discovery in the journal Science.  It is the conclusion of 12 years of amateur astronomers and citizen scientists going out at night to count the stars.  The change in stars' visibility that people reported - by submitting their star counts to an online project called Globe at Night - was equivalent to an almost 10% annual increase in sky brightness every year.  That means, the scientists say, that a child born in an area where 250 stars were visible, would probably see fewer than 100 stars in the same location 18 years later. As light pollution researchers Fabio Falchi and Salvador BarÃ¡ pointed out in an expert  commentary published alongside the research: ""Looking at the International Space Station's images and videos of the Earth at night, people generally are struck by the 'beauty' of city lights, as if they were lights on a Christmas tree.  ""They do not perceive that these are images of pollution. It is like admiring the beauty of the rainbow colours that gasoline produces in water and not recognising that it is chemical pollution."" Dr Kyba said he had hoped to see some signs of improvement in light pollution in recent years, because many urban centres have recently changed their lighting to be more energy-efficient. Towns and cities, particularly in developed countries, are swapping older streetlights for modern LEDS that are more carefully directed downwards, where the light is useful.     ""The hope was that if the light was better directed, the situation would get better,"" he said.   ""But there are so many types of lighting - streetlights, decorative, advertising. So, with all these things combined - and possibly more lighting overall - [we're] making sky brightness worse.""  According to a 2022 study by the European Space Agency the relatively low cost of LED lighting is also contributing to the problem.  The agency described this as a ""lighting paradox"", explaining: ""While the LED lighting revolution promised to reduce energy consumption and improve human vision at night, overall [light pollution has] increased. Paradoxically, the cheaper and better the lighting, the higher society's addiction to light."" Light pollution doesn't just reduce our view of the stars. It has been shown to affect human health and disrupt sleep patterns. It also affects the behaviour of some nocturnal animals, with one recent study linking it with local insect decline.  ""It does not need to be this way,"" insists Dr Kyba. ""There's a lot of room for improvement - if you light more carefully, you should be able to reduce skyglow, whilst still lighting the ground. ""And remember that light pollution is wasted energy. We're continuing to put that light energy into the atmosphere, and maybe that's not what we should be doing.""

Professor Ismail Mashal, who runs a private university in Kabul, says he has had enough of the restrictions women face in Afghanistan.   Slender and well dressed, he is a mixture of defiance and raw emotion.  ""Even if they're not allowed in - they should do this daily. It's the least they can do to prove they are men,"" he tells me, holding back tears. ""This is not me being emotional - this is pain. Men must stand up and defend the rights of Afghan women and girls."" In December the Taliban government announced female students at universities would no longer be allowed back - until further notice.  They said they were doing this to enable them to create an Islamic learning environment aligned with Sharia law practices, including changes to the curriculum.   Not long after the ban was announced, Prof Mashal went viral on social media after tearing up his academic records live on television, saying there was no point in gaining an education in today's Afghanistan.  He says he won't stay silent. ""The only power I have is my pen, even if they kill me, even if they tear me to pieces, I won't stay silent now,"" Prof Mashal says. ""I know what I am doing is risky. Every morning, I say goodbye to my mother and wife and tell them I may not return. But I am ready and willing to sacrifice my life for 20 million Afghan women and girls and for the future of my two children.""   Prof Mashal's university had 450 female students studying there and they took courses in journalism, engineering, economics and computer science. The Taliban's education minister says these degrees should not be taught to women because they are against Islam and Afghan culture.  Prof Mashal says he could have kept his institution open for male students only - but instead decided to shut it completely.   ""Education is either offered to all, or no one. The day I closed the doors of my institution, I was in a lot of pain.  ""These people are playing with the future of our girls. My students call me and ask me when I think they'll be able to go back. ""I have no answers for them. I have no answers for my 12-year-old daughter who won't be able to go to high school next year. She continues to ask me what crime she has committed?""  Since he went on TV, he has received many threats. Despite this, Prof Mashal appears on local media almost daily.   He's hoping his advocacy will lead to a nationwide campaign. But in this deeply conservative society, how likely is it that other men will join him?  Even within the Taliban government, there are those who oppose the ban on girls' education - but most have not gone public  In response to the decrees, Afghan women across the country have continued to come out onto the streets to demand their rights.  While the protests have been predominantly led by Afghan women, male students and professors over the past few weeks have also begun risking their lives by speaking out - either by refusing to sit their final exams or by resigning from their positions.  Prof Mashal says since the Taliban took over the country, he can't understand their focus on restricting women.  ""Leave these poor women alone. It's enough. There are much bigger issues that need to be dealt with. There is no law and order in this country, it's like being in a jungle.""  The former journalist, 37, says he keeps in regular contact with his female students who are heartbroken by these decisions and he worries about their mental health. One of his students, Shabnam, who was studying economics - a degree the Taliban say is inappropriate for women - says she'll never forget the day armed Taliban soldiers arrived at their school to tell them it would be the last day they could attend classes.  ""We were so afraid and left our classrooms with heavy hearts not knowing when or if we'd ever return. I haven't been able to sleep properly since. I have three sisters and many female cousins and they're all in the same situation. We feel we are trapped inside a cage or prison. Afghanistan is no country for women.""  Another student, Shabana, who was in her first semester of journalism - another degree disapproved of by the Taliban - says she is struggling to cope with the transformation the past year and a half has brought to the lives of women and girls.  ""My heart is shattered. I was hoping to be a newsreader, a good reporter some day but it feels like that dream is over. For as long as I remain in this country, I don't think we will be going back to our universities.  ""We changed the way we dressed. Classrooms were segregated. We did exactly as we were told. But it was still not enough. We feared they would do this to us and they did.  ""Everything feels incredibly bleak for me and my sister now. We are stuck at home, night turns to day and it all feels dark and bleak."" Despite Shabana's anguish, she praised Prof Mashal for taking a stance.  ""It is a very lonely time for the women and girls of my country. There aren't many men who have spoken out. We worry about his safety but we are also so grateful for his support."" Â© 2023 BBC.

Fumio Kishida said it was a case of ""now or never."" Japan - population 125 million - is estimated to have had fewer than 800,000 births last year. In the 1970s, that figure was more than two million.  Birth rates are slowing in many countries, including Japan's neighbours. But the issue is particularly acute in Japan as life expectancy has risen in recent decades, meaning there are a growing number of older people, and a declining numbers of workers to support them. Japan now has the world's second-highest proportion of people aged 65 and over - about 28% - after the tiny state of Monaco, according to World Bank data. ""Japan is standing on the verge of whether we can continue to function as a society,"" Mr Kishida told lawmakers. ""Focusing attention on policies regarding children and child-rearing is an issue that cannot wait and cannot be postponed."" He said that he eventually wants the government to double its spending on child-related programmes. A new government agency to focus on the issue would be set up in April, he added. However, Japanese governments have tried to promote similar strategies before, without success. In 2020, researchers projected Japan's population to fall from a peak of 128 million in 2017 to less than 53 million by the end of the century. The population is currently just under 125 million, according to official data. Japan has continued implementing strict immigration laws despite some relaxations, but some experts are now saying that the rules should be loosened further to help tackle its ageing society. Falling birth rates are driven by a range of factors, including rising living costs, more women in education and work, as well as greater access to contraception, leading to women choosing to have fewer children. Last week, China reported its first drop in population for 60 years. Japan is home to the oldest population in the world, after tiny Monaco. It is recording fewer births than ever before. By 2050, it could lose a fifth of its current population. Yet its hostility to immigration has not wavered. Only about 3% of Japan's population is foreign-born, compared to 15% in the UK. In Europe and America, right-wing movements point to it as a shining example of racial purity and social harmony. But Japan is not as ethnically pure as those admirers might think. There are the Ainu of Hokkaido, Okinawans in the south, half a million ethnic Koreans, and close to a million Chinese.  Then there are Japanese children with one foreign parent, which include my own three. These bi-cultural kids are known as ""hafu"" or halves - a pejorative term that's normal here. They include celebrities and sports icons, such as tennis star Naomi Osaka. Popular culture idolises them as ""more beautiful and talented"". But it's one thing to be idolised and quite another to be accepted. If you want to see what happens to a country that rejects immigration as a solution to falling fertility, Japan is a good place to start. Real wages haven't grown here in 30 years. Incomes in South Korea and Taiwan have caught up and even overtaken Japan. But change feels distant. In part it's because of a rigid hierarchy that determines who holds the levers of power.

Restoration of the Telangana Mahila Viswavidyalayam (formerly Osmania University College for Women) in Hyderabad city in the southern state of Telangana was completed this month.  The heritage building was once the residence of Colonel James Achilles Kirkpatrick, the British representative to the court at Hyderabad from 1797-1805 and was later converted into a university. Over the years the building fell into disrepair due to heavy local traffic, poor maintenance and faulty repairs.  In 2002, the World Monuments Fund (WMF) - a non-profit that champions heritage places in critical need of protection - added the building to its watchlist and launched a 20-year-project to restore it. Sections of the building were restored in phases with funding from WMF and international and local charities and private donors. In May last year, the world's largest Commonwealth heritage conversation programme stepped in to complete the last phase of work, which involved restoring three historic gates and the building's central hall.  The Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Commonwealth Heritage Skills Training Programme - funded by the UK-based charity Hamish Ogston Foundation -  contributed Â£157,000 ($193,000) towards the project and also gave youngsters from UK and Hyderabad a chance to work on the building and learn conservation techniques from experts.  The university is the first of 20 projects selected by the programme for restoration. The next project by the programme will be to repair Roxburgh House in the Botanical Gardens in the eastern city of Kolkata. The university is a prominent educational institution in Hyderabad. It currently educates more than 2,500 women every year at undergraduate, postgraduate, diploma and certificate levels across various streams. The restored building will offer more facilities for the university. Green space has been created on either side of the central mall for recreation, and areas of the college campus widely used by students and staff have been spruced up. An university gate named after Lieutenant Roberts, who fought at the siege and capture of Delhi in 1857, was also restored. Trainees practiced slaking lime, sieving, mixing and preparing mortar while working on the gate. Experts worked on restoring the papier mache ceiling in the university's grand durbar hall. They had to put together small and large fragments of the ceiling that had fallen off over the years and had been preserved by the authorities. ""It was quite a painstaking process - we wanted to use each and every fragment or piece and it was a task trying to incorporate them all in the mending and restoring processes,"" says Maninder Singh Gill, an art conservator who worked on restoring the ceiling. The building is in the style of a Palladian villa and is similar in design to the White House in the United States.  Kirkpatrick had built the colonial mansion for himself and his Indian wife, Khair-un-Nissa. William Dalrymple's 2002 book, White Mughals, is based on their relationship and captured how their love transcended all religious, political and cultural boundaries at the time.

Mr Nichols died in hospital three days after being pulled over for alleged reckless driving. He was pepper sprayed, kicked and punched by five officers who have since lost their jobs and been charged with his murder.  Video of the arrest, taken from body cameras and a surveillance camera mounted to a pole, was released in four instalments made public on Friday.  The BBC has reviewed the footage, which is graphically violent and full of expletives. This article contains descriptions that some people may find distressing  Only a small number of people had seen the videos before Friday evening, including Mr Nichols' family, their legal team and several officials.  The first video released shows the initial traffic stop that led to Mr Nichols' fatal encounter with police. None of the videos released show what prompted police to perform a traffic stop. But within a minute of being pulled over, officers can be heard yelling profanities and threats, and ordering him out of his car. ""I didn't do anything!"" he says. The officers then force him to the ground as he protests his innocence. An officer can be heard threatening to break his arms as they instruct him to get on his stomach and lie flat. A scuffle appears to ensue in which Mr Nichols breaks free of the officers and flees on foot. The officers deploy pepper spray and at least one taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. He is not seen again in this first portion of the video. The rest of the footage shows officers using water to spray their eyes after being hit with pepper spray. The officer wearing the bodycam - who is white and does not appear to be one of the five facing charges - can be heard saying that he hopes his fellow officers ""stomp"" Nichols when they find him. The officers catch up with Mr Nichols, who is quickly taken to the ground.  As two officers are working to restrain him, a third can be seen walking up to him and kicking him in the head twice.  Moments later, a fourth officer - it is unclear who - pulls out an expandable baton and strikes Mr Nichols several times. Officers also punch him several times.  He appears to be stumbling by this time and is offering no resistance.  At the five-minute mark, Mr Nichols is on the ground and appears to be writhing. By this point, officers are no longer striking him.  He is then taken to one of the unmarked police vehicles, where he is leaned against the door. Officers are shining their torches at him and it is unclear if he is still responsive.  This video, taken from a police-worn body camera, captured the same brutal encounter, but from a different angle, and contained audio.  About a minute into the video, two officers can be seen wrestling with Mr Nichols. The officer wearing the bodycam threatens to spray him.  ""Mom!"" Mr Nichols calls out in distress. Soon after, another scuffle ensues as the police call for Mr Nichols to ""give them your hands"". The officer wearing the bodycam walks away, apparently having been hit with pepper spray during the confrontation.  In the background, officers can still be heard yelling at Mr Nichols to give them his hands and lie flat.  The officer wearing the bodycam returns and pulls out his expandable baton - which we also saw clearly in the second video from the pole cam. Using an expletive, he yells at Mr Nichols and makes clear he plans to strike him with the baton.  He strikes him several times, and another officer can be seen punching Mr Nichols in the face while his hands are restrained behind him.  The officer wearing the bodycam calls in their location, and officers can be seen struggling with Mr Nichols as more police arrive.  The officer can be heard telling another that Mr Nichols made him spray himself.  The other officer replies that he tazed him, using an expletive.  The video ends with the officer wearing the bodycam walking away and panting from exhaustion.  The fourth and final video is from the bodycam of another unnamed officer. It shows the same incident as the third video. The footage begins with a brief chase that ends with the officers tackling Mr Nichols. It appears that the bodycam becomes detached from the officer, as for the first few minutes nothing can be seen and we can only hear what sounds like a scuffle and conversation. We again hear Mr Nichols calling out for his mother, and officers using expletives while ordering him to give them his hands. At one point, the officers can be heard telling one another that they thought Mr Nichols was ""on something"" - seeming to indicate that they believed he had been using drugs. There is no known evidence that this was the case. Once the officer's bodycam is back on, we get a clearer view of Mr Nichols as he is slumped against the unmarked police car. He appears to be injured and blood is visible on his head. He does not speak. One officer pulls him up after he slumps to the side. He is variously seen sitting up, leaning on the car or slumped on the ground. A significant portion of the video shows officers speaking to one another and recounting details of the incident. Some of the officers claim that Mr Nichols ""swung"" at them or reached for their guns. Neither allegation is supported by the released video. Another officer later claims Mr Nichols swerved and almost struck his police vehicle. Officers can also be heard discussing the fact that nothing was found in his car. Towards the end of the footage, we get a clear view of Mr Nichols, who appears to be seriously injured and in pain. An officer - it is unclear who - repeatedly asks him what ""he had"" - again suggesting that they believed he was using drugs at the time of the incident. It doesn't appear that Nichols is able to answer. The officer repeatedly tells him that ""you can't go nowhere"". In total, about 10 people stand by, with no one offering to help Mr Nichols, who is in visible distress. Some of the last few minutes of video are blurred out and redacted - officials had said that some parts would be redacted according to the state's public records laws. Â© 2023 BBC.

Russia is usually represented at the event, as the camp in occupied Poland was liberated by the Soviet Army. But this year, following Moscow's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum declined to invite Russian officials and its director likened the Ukraine war to the horrors of the Holocaust. In response, Russia accused the museum of attempting to ""rewrite history"".  At the event on Friday, museum director Piotr Cywinski said Auschwitz was created by Nazi ""megalomania"" and a ""similar sick megalomania"" and ""similar lust for power"" had driven Russia's destruction of Mariupol and Donetsk.  Speaking to an audience including camp survivors, he warned that ""once again, innocent people are being killed en masse in Europe"". ""Russia, unable to conquer Ukraine, has decided to destroy it. We see it every day, even as we stand here. And so it is difficult to stand here today."" Reacting to the decision, Russia said Soviet soldiers who freed Auschwitz would not be forgotten.  ""No matter how our European 'non-partners' contrived in their attempts to rewrite history in a new way, the memory of the Soviet heroes-liberators and horrors of Nazism cannot be erased,"" Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote in a pointed social media post. Auschwitz survivors also expressed their fears over the fallout of the war in Ukraine at the event. Polish survivor Zdzislawa Wlodarczyk said she was ""scared to hear what is happening in the East"". She told the audience that she had arrived in Auschwitz as an 11-year-old following the Warsaw Uprising, a failed attempt by the Polish resistance in 1944 to liberate the city from the German occupiers. She and her 7-year-old brother remained in the camp until the Soviet army liberated it. ""The Russian armies that liberated us are now waging war on Ukraine. Why? Why? That's what politics is,"" she said. The Polish nation has stood firm in its support for Ukraine during the conflict, with Poles housing hundreds of thousands of refugees in their own homes and offering military support to its neighbour. Russian officials have taken part in their own commemorative events, with Vladimir Putin meeting Russia's top rabbis on the eve of the remembrance day on Thursday. The Russian leader said he was ""pursuing a policy meaning nothing like this in the history of mankind will ever happen again"". Russia's Chief Rabbi Berel Lazar has spoken about his regret that Russia has been excluded from the commemoration, warning that ""these political games have no place on Holocaust day"". He told AFP: ""For us, this is clearly a humiliation because we perfectly know and remember the role of the Red [Soviet] Army in the liberation of Auschwitz and in the victory over Nazism."" Friday's event marks the 78th anniversary of the Soviet army liberating the concentration and extermination camp in German-occupied Poland, where more than one million people were murdered by the Nazis.  Auschwitz-Birkenau was created as a part of the Holocaust, a process that started with discrimination against Jewish people, and ended with six million Jews being killed because of who they were. In total, 1.1 million people died in the camp, around one million Jews from across Europe as well as Poles, Soviet POWs, Roma and Sinti.  Â© 2023 BBC.

There have been long queues at some banks as Nigerians have struggled to meet the original deadline of Tuesday. People now have until 10 February to do the swap. The redesign of the higher denomination naira notes has been heavily criticised with analysts saying six weeks was not enough time for Africa's most-populous country to phase out the old currency.   It is happening a few weeks before the country goes to the polls in presidential and parliamentary elections. Local media has been reporting that there are not enough of the new notes in circulation, with people unable to withdraw them from banks.  The move by the the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is seen as a push to encourage Nigerians to embrace digital payments in a society where cash is king. It hopes the exchange will bring some of the cash currently being hoarded by individuals and companies back into the banking system. When the bank announced in October that the 1,000 ($2.18, Â£1.75), 500 and 200 naira notes were to be replaced, it said 80% of the notes in circulation were outside banks. The CBN believes that with the redesigned currency it will have a better understanding of the money circulating in the economy so it can better manage inflation.  The bank governor said the new deadline of 10 February would allow more people in rural areas, where there are very few bank branches, to exchange the old notes. He added that Nigerians would then have a further seven days to deposit old notes directly with the CBN. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Mr Nichols, 29, was fatally beaten by five police officers in January. Speaking to US media, Ben Crump urged President Joe Biden to use Mr Nichols's death to gain support for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. And he said Mr Nichols's mother was coping with her son's loss by hoping that his death could lead to change. ""She believes in her heart Tyre was sent here for an assignment and that there is going to be greater good that comes from this tragedy,"" Mr Crump said.  The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was introduced in 2021 after Mr Floyd was killed by a white police officer kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. His death sparked international protests. The bill would see a federal ban on the use of chokeholds by police and make it easier to bring charges against offending officers.  Lawmakers in the House of Representatives - which was then controlled by the Democratic Party - passed the bill in March 2021, but it was later held up by opposition in the Senate.  ""Shame on us if we don't use his tragic death to finally get the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed,"" Mr Crump told CNN. The lawyer said if the law did not change, deaths at the hands of police would continue.  Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP civil rights group - also called on legislators to take action.  ""By failing to write a piece of legislation, you're writing another obituary,"" Mr Johnson said in a statement. ""We can name all the victims of police violence, but we can't name a single law you have passed to address it."" But the Republican House of Representatives Judiciary chair Jim Jordan warned politicians to not rush legislation.  ""These five individuals did not have any respect for life... I don't know if there's anything you can do to stop the kind of evil we saw in that video,"" he told NBC's Meet the Press programme.  A childhood friend of Mr Nichols told the BBC his legacy would be preserved through legal reform. Angelina Paxton said he ""always wanted to change the world"".   Ms Paxton said Mr Nichols was ""very passionate about Black Lives Matter"". ""He always wanted to make a difference,"" she said. ""If it gives anyone any comfort out of all those pain that we're all going through right now, just know that I can guarantee you he's up there right now smiling, because he finally did what he always wanted to do.""  On Saturday, the Memphis Police Department disbanded the so-called Scorpion special unit of which the police officers now charged with murder were members.  The unit was a 50-person team that was tasked with bringing down crime levels - particularly car thefts and gang-related offences.  Scorpion stood for ""Street Crimes Operations to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods"". The five officers - Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr, Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith - were fired from the Memphis police force last week. Four of the five posted bail and were released from custody by Friday morning, according to jail records. Lawyers for Mr Martin and Mr Mills have said their clients will plead not guilty. In an interview with BBC News on Friday, Memphis Police Chief CJ Davis said the Scorpion unit was created to be ""more responsive"" and ""more proactive"" to gun violence in the city. But she acknowledged that the officers who brutally beat Tyre Nichols ""decided to go off the rails"".   ""We are doing an individual evaluation of all units,"" she said. ""This is a necessary step. We want to be fully transparent to the community.""   Shelby County Sheriff Floyd Bonner Jr said two deputy sheriffs who ""appeared on the scene following"" the confrontation have also been suspending pending an internal investigation.

The ministry said the site suffered only minor damage, though this has not been independently verified. The Wall Street Journal and New York Times quoted unnamed US officials as saying Israel was behind the attack. Israel has not commented. The purpose of the site is unclear, though reports suggest it could be connected to missile production. Iran's defence ministry said three drones were involved in the attack on Saturday night at about 23:30 (20:00 GMT). It said one was destroyed by air defence systems and two were caught by ""defence traps"", causing minor damage to a building. There were no casualties, it said. Local authorities did not comment on activities at the site, but called it a ""workshop"". Iran's official Irna news agency said the drones had targeted ""an ammunition manufacturing plant"". Isfahan province is home to a large air base, a major missile production complex and several nuclear sites.  Pentagon spokesperson Brig Gen Patrick Ryder said the US military played no part in the strikes, but declined to speculate further, Reuters news agency reported. The Wall Street Journal quoted unnamed ""US officials and people familiar with the operation"" as saying Israel had carried out the attack. The New York Times said it was the work of the Mossad, Israel's intelligence service, according to ""senior [US] intelligence officials"". If confirmed it would mark the first such known attack on a facility in Iran under the current Israeli government which came to power under Benjamin Netanyahu at the end of December. Israel has previously admitted to carrying out hundreds of strikes against Iranian targets in Syria, which it says is aimed to stop the transfer of weapons from Iran to militants in Lebanon. Iran does not recognise Israel's right to exist and the two countries are bitter foes. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said the ""cowardly"" incident on Saturday night was an attempt to destabilise the country. The attack comes amid heightened tensions over Iran's nuclear programme and its supply of arms to Russia's war in Ukraine. The country has also been wracked by internal turmoil in recent months, spurred by the death of a woman who was detained for violating Iran's strict dress code. In a separate incident on Saturday, Irna reported a fire broke out at an oil facility near the north-western city of Tabriz. No details about the cause have been revealed. In recent years, there have been a number of explosions, fires and cyber attacks on Iranian military, nuclear and industrial facilities. Additional reporting by Josh Cheetham Â© 2023 BBC.

Will any of the frontrunners, most of whom have been in the political system for decades, be able to turn the country around? From high inflation to deadly attacks by gunmen against innocent civilians, the seven-year rule of outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari has seen Nigeria face various crises.  His supporters say he has done his best and highlight achievements, such as his work on infrastructure projects and attempts to combat violent extremism. But even his own wife, Aisha Buhari, has apologised to the Nigerian people for falling short of their expectations.  So whoever wins the election will not have an easy job. It is due to take place on Saturday 25 February 2023. If there is no clear winner, a second round will be held within three weeks. There will also be elections for the country's powerful state governors on Saturday 11 March. The head of the election commission has dismissed suggestions that the vote could be delayed because of insecurity. A total of 18 candidates are campaigning for the top job, but only three have a realistic chance of winning, according to opinion polls. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, 70, is standing for the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) party. Known as a political godfather in the south-west region, he wields a huge amount of influence but has been dogged by allegations of corruption over the years and poor health, both of which he denies. Some say his campaign slogan Emi Lokan, which means ""it's my turn [to be president]"" in the Yoruba language, shows a sense of entitlement. Atiku Abubakar, 76, is running on behalf of the main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP). He has run for the presidency five times before - all of which he has lost. Most of his career has been in the corridors of power, having worked as a top civil servant, vice-president under Olusegun Obasanjo and a prominent businessman. Just like Mr Tinubu, he has been accused of corruption and cronyism, which he denies. Peter Obi, 61, is hoping to break up the two-party system which has dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999 and is running for the little known Labour Party. Although he was in the PDP until last year, he is seen as a relatively fresh face and enjoys fervent support on social media and amongst Nigeria's youth. The wealthy businessman served as governor of the south-eastern Anambra State from 2006 to 2014. His backers, known as the ""OBIdients"" say he is the only candidate with integrity, but his critics argue that a vote for Obi is wasted as he is unlikely to win. Convention suggests a candidate from one of the two main parties will win - Mr Atiku or Mr Tinubu. But Mr Obi's supporters are hoping he can spring a surprise if they can mobilise the large youth vote to back him. In order to win, a candidate has to obtain the highest number of votes nationwide, and more than a quarter of ballots cast in at least two-thirds of Nigeria's states. If none of the candidates manage this, there will be a second round, or a run-off, within 21 days between the top two candidates.  Reducing insecurity is one of the key concerns of voters, in a country which is currently experiencing a kidnapping-for-ransom crisis and battling a militant Islamist insurgency in parts of the north. Two of the most shocking cases last year were a mass shooting at a Catholic Church in Owo and the storming by gunmen of a passenger train in which dozens of people were killed or kidnapped. President Buhari says he has fulfilled his promise to ""frontally and courageously tackle terrorism"", but many Nigerians feel the country is still not safe. The economy is another area of concern. In 2022 inflation rose for 10 months in a row, just dipping to 21.3% according to the latest figures released this month. This rising cost of living has left many families struggling to make ends meet, with local media describing the situation as ""dire"". Unemployment is also a major problem, leaving many graduates fearful that they may not find work even after years of university study. Latest figures from the country's National Bureau of Statistics show that 33% of the population is unemployed - jumping to 42.5% for younger adults. Despite being a major oil producer, four out of 10 Nigerians live below the poverty line and ""lack education and access to basic infrastructure, such as electricity, safe drinking water, and improved sanitation,"" according to the World Bank.  Many of the candidates have put these issues at the centre of their campaigns.  But these problems have been mounting for several years, leaving some Nigerians sceptical about whether whoever wins the election will actually be able to fix them. Despite the large number of registered voters -  93.5 million - concerns persist about apathy and how many people will actually show up on the day to cast their ballot.  With almost 40% of registered voters under 34, the vote has been called the ""election of young people"" by elections chief Mahmood Yakubu. In previous elections in Nigeria there have been credible reports of politicians rigging the polls, by either causing violence to scare away voters or snatching ballot boxes and stuffing them. But the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) says the use of new technology will help ensure the ballot is secure and is not marred by fraud or rigging. There have also been cases of politicians paying poor voters to back them, even at polling stations. But a recent change of the naira notes has forced a cash crunch that will make vote-buying difficult, and security agents also arrest suspects who either give or receive money. Inec has also said it is illegal for voters to take phones into the polling booths and take pictures of their ballot papers, as this proof is usually demanded by the vote buyers. Some Inec offices have been attacked in the run-up to the vote. Last November the election body held an emergency meeting over the attacks on its buildings, which local media described as a ""disturbing trend"". There have also been complaints about suspicious voter registration. Last year digital sleuths uncovered voter cards on the digital electoral register that appeared to have pictures of children on them. The legal age to vote in Nigeria is 18. Some others on the preliminary list seemed to have registered more than once, by changing their facial expression, clothes or the way they were sitting. At the time of the discoveries, Inec said it welcomed the help of Nigerians to clean up the register. On 11 January, Inec released a new register, from which it said 53,264 ineligible voters had been removed. It also said that underage voters and vote buyers would be prosecuted.  As well as the presidential vote, the public will also be choosing their representatives for parliament - the National Assembly. There are 469 legislators made up of 109 Senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives. Two weeks later on 11 March there will also be elections to choose governors for 28 out of Nigeria's 36 states. In order to vote, you need to have a valid Permanent Voter's Card (PVC), which essentially shows that you are registered to vote and proves the identity of the voter. The PVC contains biometrical data of the voter, used as further verification on election day. This data is stored in the card. However, there is limited time, as the deadline for getting a PVC is 5 February. To cast your ballot, you need to arrive at your polling station between the hours of 08:00 and 14:00 with your PVC. As long as you're in the queue to vote by 14:00, you will be allowed to cast your ballot, Inec says. Nigerians living in the diaspora are not allowed to vote abroad. This election is different to previous ones because a new system is being used - the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), which is a device introduced by Inec in 2021 aimed at stopping election fraud. The BVAS is essentially a small rectangular box with a screen that is more technologically advanced than the Smart Card Readers used in the past. The key benefit of the BVAS is that it has the capacity to perform dual identification of voters on election day through their fingerprints and facial recognition. This should stop people without valid PVCs from voting, as well as those who are ineligible to vote attempting to do so.  Another aspect of the BVAS is that it uploads vote results directly to the Inec results viewing portal for all to see, which in theory means results cannot be tampered with.  There have been concerns about the BVAS after it experienced glitches in state-wide elections in 2021 and 2022, but Inec insists these problems have been resolved. In the last two presidential elections the winner has been known on the third day after voting. But votes will be counted as soon as voting ends on Saturday 25 February. Those who stay behind at their polling station will have the result announced to them, but it is a long process before all the results work their way up to Abuja from the tens of thousands of polling units across the country. BVAS might speed up the process this year, but Inec-appointed officials will still have to travel to Abuja from the 36 states with hard copies to be read aloud. Only then will the Inec chairman announce a winner - or that a second round is needed. Additional reporting by Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja Â© 2023 BBC.

It might sound familiar, but we're not talking about Northern Ireland. ""I don't care if this is English, British or even French, we would just like to live together and have a pleasant life. We don't care about politics,"" says Jose. He is one of the many thousands of workers who make the journey into Gibraltar every day from Spain. He's been doing it for 30 years, working mostly in hospitality. ""I would like the border to disappear,"" he tells me, standing beside a statue celebrating Spanish workers in Gibraltar. The small but significant British overseas territory lies at the southern end of the Iberian peninsula. It was not included in the permanent post-Brexit deal which now governs the UK's relations with the EU. Instead, it has been operating on ad hoc arrangements. The people of Gibraltar are fiercely patriotic, often called ""more British than the British"". But the reality is more complex.  The territory voted by 96% to stay part of the EU in 2016's referendum. English is the official language, but people also speak Spanish, often switching between the two in a form of code switching they call Llanito. Thousands of people cross the border regularly, to work, shop or to see family. There is a great affection for Spain and its people, but an intense suspicion of the Spanish state. It has meant that discussions over their future relationship have been sensitive, to say the least. The talks resume in London on Thursday. Officially, they are between the UK and EU, but Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo is at the table too. It is he who will have to sell any deal, if one is reached, but he knows it will not be easy to please everyone. We go to meet him at his office in Convent Place. Outside are two huge cannon; a clear reminder of the military origins of Gibraltar. A lawyer by trade, Mr Picardo is clear and confident in his answers. He says what's certain is that Gibraltar can't return to its pre-Brexit reality. ""[No deal would] be uncomfortable in some ways, but even a negotiated outcome is going to be uncomfortable in some ways because we have to get used to a different way of operating in the movement of goods, in our immigration system."" He may be being somewhat diplomatic in that assessment. Like almost everyone else in Gibraltar, he was a staunch advocate of remain. ""I'm not a diplomat. I'm a politician. I tell it as it is. But I'm also conscious that I'm involved in the negotiation and I'm not going to tell the other side all the difficulties we may have."" The talks have been shrouded in secrecy, but for Dr Jennifer Ballantine-Perera from the Gibraltar Garrison Library, the status of the border is at the heart of them. ""That border tells Gibraltarians in no uncertain terms that Gibraltar is not Spanish. And the border also avoids any slippage into Spain."" She is clear on what she believes is most important to people here: ""There's no erosion of British sovereignty and that is reflected in how the border is managed."" That doesn't mean the border should be impenetrable. At Saccone and Speed, a wine merchant operating in Gibraltar since 1839, Guy Povedano stands in his cavernous warehouse, in the shadow of hundreds of barrels of beer. His business depends on tourists and workers coming through from Spain and he hopes a new agreement will ensure a free-flowing movement of people. ""[I'd like] an agile border,"" he says. ""A workable border where we can get the goods in but where there's an element of control."" By his own admission, he wants the best of both worlds. Sharon and Alex are an example of how people's everyday lives are intimately linked to both sides of the border. Sharon works in a pub in Gibraltar, but is from La Linea just across the border in Spain. Her boyfriend Alex is with the Royal Navy, on a ship moored just off the coast. The thought of the crossing getting harder fills her with dread. ""It will be terrible. He has to work. I have to work. I have to study. For the people that have to come to work here, they will be late and I will be late for sure. So it [would be] impossible to work, to have a normal life."" In theory, there is no ""cliff edge"" to the talks. In theory, the temporary agreements made in 2020, which currently see fairly free movement, could simply continue. There is, however, a political reality on the horizon that means a deal needs to be secured soon. Later this year, Spain will elect a new government. The incumbent Socialists are generally seen as more sympathetic to Gibraltar. If they are replaced with the Popular Party, potentially with the backing of the far-right Vox, any goodwill may go out the window. That is why talk of what ""no-deal"" might look like is vital, with Mr Picardo claiming it could bring opportunities. He mentions the pre-Brexit idea of turning London into ""Singapore-on-Thames"", a low-tax, light-regulation business haven. ""Gibraltar is not looking to become that, but there are opportunities - given you are not in the EU-regulated space - if you become Singapore-on-Straits."" Is that a warning to Brussels? ""I'm not here to threaten, I'm not here to cajole. I think our best efforts should be directed at having a treaty between the United Kingdom and the European Union on Gibraltar."" Both sides have agreed that sovereignty of the Rock is not on the table in these negotiations, but people of the British overseas territory still approach the talks with great trepidation. For many of them, their division from Spain is more important than any other issue, even the economy. Principle comes up against pragmatism, with one potentially having to lose out. If that situation sounds familiar - maybe it is. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

Ms Ardern announced that she was quitting as the country's leader on Thursday, citing burnout.  Threats against her became more frequent in recent years and included a man claiming he had the right to ""shoot the prime minister"" for treason and treachery in a YouTube video.  Chris Hipkins, who was speaking on Sunday after MPs from his ruling Labour Party voted unanimously to endorse him, said a ""small minority"" of Kiwis were responsible for abusing Ms Ardern. He said that ""it does not represent who we are as a country"". Men had a responsibility to call out misogyny, he added. He said he realised that putting himself forward as leader meant that he was ""public property"" - but that his family were not, and he wanted his children to have a ""typical Kiwi kid life"".  Data released in June showed that threats against Ms Ardern had almost tripled over three years, and local media reported that at least eight threats against her had entered the legal system - including the man who filmed the threatening YouTube video. Police also had to investigate after handwritten fliers vowing to ""eradicate"" Ms Ardern were delivered to several homes in January 2022.  Radio New Zealand spoke to a former intelligence worker, Paul Buchanan, who said he believed Ms Ardern would need more ongoing security and protection than any former New Zealand prime minister.  Mr Hipkins, 44, was New Zealand's Covid response minister and has extensive political experience. He is set to be sworn in as prime minister on Wednesday after Ms Ardern formally steps down. He received a standing ovation from his colleagues after they gave him their backing on Sunday, and shared a hug with Ms Ardern, whom he described as ""my very good friend"".  Mr Hipkins has named Carmel Sepuloni as his deputy, making her the first person of Pasifika descent to hold the role. ""I am proudly Samoan, Tongan and New Zealand European, and represent generations of New Zealanders with mixed heritage,"" she said. ""I want to acknowledge the significance of this for our Pacific community."" Around eight percent of New Zealand's population identify themselves as being Kiwis with Pacific island descent.  Mr Hipkins will announce his full Cabinet later but has said he plans to keep the former deputy prime minister, Grant Robertson, on as finance minister.  Outlining his priorities as prime minister, he promised to help Kiwi families and businesses through the country's cost of living crisis - which will be a key issue in the general election later this year.

The next seven-year budget would increase to â¬413bn (Â£360bn) from 2024-30, up from â¬295bn, he said. First France had to repair and restock its armed forces, then transform them, he told soldiers at Mont-de-Marsan airbase in south-west France. ""We must not do the same with more, we have to do better and differently."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted Western countries to review military spending - and in many cases, increase it significantly. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has outlined plans to increase the number of combat soldiers from 1.15 million to 1.5 million. President Vladimir Putin said this week that Russia's powerful defence industry left him in no doubt that victory in Ukraine was assured. President Macron acknowledged on Friday there were no more post-Cold War ""peace dividends"" now that Russia had invaded Ukraine, so the aim was to renew a military that protected France's freedom, security, prosperity and place in the world. Key to his reforms are a 60% hike in the military intelligence budget, adapting to ""high-intensity"" conflict with investment in drones, cyber-defence and improved air defences. ""We need to be one war ahead,"" he warned.  France's failure to foresee the Russian invasion last February cost the head of military intelligence, Gen Eric Vidaud, his job. The armed forces chief admitted at the time that US and UK intelligence had read the situation correctly. France has stepped up its military aid for Ukraine in recent weeks, with plans to send AMX-10 RC ""light combat tanks"", but its supply of weapons to Kyiv is seen as lagging behind other European allies. Last year, France ended an eight-year anti-jihadist operation in the Sahel region of Africa in what was widely seen as a failure.  President Macron said France would have to rethink its alliances while remaining a leader in Europe and a reliable Nato ally, and deepening its relationships with Germany, the UK, Italy and Spain. The Russian war has changed defence priorities across Europe, with Sweden and Finland announcing steep increases in their military budgets as part of their bid to join Nato. Members of the Western military alliance have agreed to spend at least 2% of economic output on defence from 2024. Days after the invasion in February 2022, Germany pledged an extra â¬100bn of the budget to the armed forces.  In June, the UK promised under previous Prime Minister Boris Johnson to increase spending to 2.5% of GDP. Last month, Japan announced a dramatic rise in its defence budget, because of what Prime Minister Kishida Fumio warned was the ""most severe and complex security environment since World War Two"". It cited threats from China and North Korea. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

It happened as thousands had gathered in the majority Asian-American city of Monterey Park, California, for the festival. Many expressed shock and fear on learning that a gunman had entered the Star Ballroom Dance Studio, a popular dance hall, and fired multiple rounds at patrons before fleeing the scene. He has been identified as Huu Can Tran, a 72-year-old of Asian descent. His motive remains unclear. Wong Wei told the Los Angeles Times that his friend was at the club but had been in the bathroom when the shooting began. He said that when she came out, she saw the gunman firing indiscriminately from a long gun, and she also saw three people lying dead, including a boss of the club. She escaped to Mr Wei's nearby home, he said. The attack on the dance studio took place on Garvey Avenue, home to several Asian-owned businesses. Seung Won Choi, the owner of a seafood barbecue restaurant across the street from the club, told the newspaper that three pedestrians had run inside and asked him to lock the door. They said they had seen a man with a semi-automatic gun and multiple rounds of ammunition, he said. Monterey Park is home to about 60,000 people, of which roughly two-thirds are of Asian descent. Many locals were still digesting the news on Sunday, and what it meant for the community. Connie Chung Joe, who runs Asian Americans Advancing Justice Southern California, which had a booth at the festival, told Associated Press the impact has been profound, regardless of the motive. ""Having this tragedy on one of our most important holidays... it feels very personal to our community,"" she said. ""There is still that feeling of being targeted, and being fearful, when we hear about a shooting like this."" Monterey Park City Council member Thomas Wong, whose district is where the shooting occurred, told the Washington Post he was in shock, and anxiously waiting for news about the victims. Also uppermost in his mind was the rise in anti-Asian violence in recent years, he said. ""Regardless of the motive and whether this was a hate crime, the fact of the matter is this type of violence is sparking fear in our community, in our Asian American community."" Pastor and writer Raymond Chang said this tragedy was another shock to a community still reeling from the spike in anti-Asian hate.  ""We have not had enough time and space to heal from all the collective trauma and loss our communities have gone through,"" Mr Chang, who is also president of the Asian-American Christian Collaborative, told USA Today.  ""Incidents like these add to the unprocessed pain and trauma that has piled up over the years."" Representative Judy Chu, who chairs the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and is a former mayor of the city, tweeted: ""My heart is broken for the victims, their families, and the people of my hometown Monterey Park.""

Judges said the appointment of Aryeh Deri, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, was ""extremely unreasonable"". The justice minister called the ruling ""absurd"". Shas said it was ""political"". The decision aggravates an already unprecedented clash between the new government and the entire legal system. The government - the most right-wing in Israel's history - has drawn up a bill which, if written into law, would allow politicians to override rulings by the Supreme Court and increase their influence over the selection of judges.   Tens of thousands of people protested on Saturday in Tel Aviv against the proposed changes, after the Supreme Court's president warned that they would deal a ""fatal blow"" to Israel's democratic character. Mr Netanyahu - who is currently on trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, which he denies - rejected the criticism. This video can not be played Watch: Thousands of Israelis hold legal reforms protest in Tel Aviv Before the government took office last month, members of parliament from his coalition changed a law to allow someone recently convicted of a crime to serve as a minister if their prison sentence was suspended.  Mr Netanyahu and his allies believed that would allow Mr Deri to be serve as interior minister and health minister, but 10 of the Supreme Court's 11 justices ruled in favour of legal petitions challenging his appointment. ""Most of the judges have determined that this appointment is extremely unreasonable and thus the prime minister must remove Deri from office,"" a summary of their ruling said. The Haaretz newspaper quoted Supreme Court President Esther Hayut as saying the prime minister was not entitled to ignore Mr Deri's ""accumulation of serious corruption offenses"". She added that having him in charge of two important ministries ""damages the image and reputation of the country's legal system and contradicts principles of ethical conduct and legality"".   In 1999, Mr Deri was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of taking bribes, fraud and breach of trust while serving as interior minister. He was released after 22 months and returned to parliament in 2013. Last January, a court agreed to a plea deal in which Mr Deri admitted to tax fraud. He was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and fined $53,300 (Â£43,200).  He also resigned as an MP, which meant the court did not decide whether his offence involved ""moral turpitude"" - a finding that would have barred him from running for office for seven years. Mr Deri was re-elected in November, when Shas won 11 seats in parliament and agreed to go into coalition with Mr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, as well the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party and the far-right Religious Zionism alliance. Shas condemned the Supreme Court ruling as ""political"", ""extremely unreasonable"" and ""unprecedented"", and warned that it ""tossed away the voice and vote of 400,000 Shas voters"". The party earlier suggested the government could not sit without their leader in it. Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a member of Likud, said the ruling was a ""blatant injustice"" and that he was saddened the court had ""failed to respect the people's will, the prime minister's judgement, and the Knesset's decision that expressed confidence in the current government"". A joint statement from the leaders of the parties in the coalition promised to act ""in any legal way available to us and without delay, to correct the injustice and the harm that has been caused to the democratic decision and the sovereignty of the people"". The leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, warned them that the government would be breaking the law and risking an ""unprecedented constitutional crisis"" if Mr Deri was not fired. ""A government that does not heed the law is an illegal government. It no longer can demand citizens to abide by the law,"" the head of the centrist Yesh Atid party and former prime minister said.

Another 10 people were wounded and some are in a critical condition. The shooting in Monterey Park, which has a large Asian population, happened shortly after thousands of people had gathered for a Lunar New Year festival. The gunman opened fire on a busy dance studio in the downtown area of the city. Officers arrived at the scene at 22:22 local time on Saturday (06:22 GMT on Sunday) and found people ""pouring out of the location screaming"", Captain Andrew Meyer said. Victims were treated both inside the Star Ballroom Dance Studio and in the car park outside, police said.  Officers are hunting for a male suspect between the age of 30 and 50 who fled the scene, but have received different descriptions of the attacker. Dozens of witnesses are being interviewed. ""We need to get this person off the street as soon as possible,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said at a news conference on Sunday. He gave no details about the weapon used but said the suspect may have fled in a white van. The motive for the attack is still unclear. The centre of Monterey Park, including West Garvey Avenue where the shooting happened, was decorated for Lunar New Year with red lanterns and banners.  The celebration is one of the largest in California and attracted tens of thousands of people throughout the day. Two days of celebrations were planned, but officials cancelled Sunday's events following the shooting. There is a large police presence in the city - which is about seven miles (11km) east of downtown Los Angeles - and much of the area near the dance studio has been sealed off. Police are investigating the possibility that the suspect entered a second dance studio around 30 minutes after the attack.  The weapon he was carrying was wrestled from him by someone at the Alhambra dance studio, according to police. No one was injured at that location. ""We believe that there's an incident that may be related,"" Sheriff Luna said. ""It's definitely on our radar."" Chester Chong, the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce Los Angeles, told BBC News the community had been stunned by the attack.  ""This just should not happen,"" he said, adding that he was worried for his friend who owns the Star Ballroom Dance Studio. Others who were in the area at the time of the attack said they heard sounds they thought were fireworks. ""I thought maybe it had something to do with Lunar New Year,"" Tony Lai, 35, told the Associated Press. One eyewitness said three people ran into his restaurant and told him to lock the door as there was a man with a machine gun in the area. Video shared on social media showed police and firefighters rushing to an area on Garvey Avenue and treating the victims. The attack is one of the worst shootings in California's modern history - the deadliest was in 1984, when a gunman killed 21 people at a McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro, near San Diego. President Joe Biden had been briefed and has ordered the FBI to support the local authorities, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. The mayor of Alhambra, Sasha RenÃ©e PÃ©rez, said it was ""especially painful"" the tragedy happened on a Lunar New Year weekend.   ""Residents should be celebrating with family, friends and loved ones - not fearing gun violence,"" she said. California's Governor Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, described the shooting as a ""horrific and heartless"" act of gun violence and expressed his sympathies.

She broke into spontaneous song as she stood outside her home, expressing sorrow but also a resilience shown by so many in Ogbia where many own small plots of land to grow crops. ""On our farm the water was above our heads so we had to take the risk of diving to harvest our cassava,"" she said. ""It brought so much destruction and hunger to our community. I am a sociology student and the flood was a disaster to me academically. I lost so many learning hours. My textbooks, handouts and notebooks are all damaged. I don't know where to start from now because I support myself with farming as a student."" The residents living on the lower level of Dorcas Apartments, accommodation for university students, have been all flooded. ""None of us have had any assistance in this terrible situation,"" said Joy Christian, whose husband is a caretaker of the building. ""We have seen huge rains this year, more than ever, but we know that this flood came from a dam being opened in Cameroon,"" said Eruabai Ase Otuaba (above). ""We thought the 2012 floods were the worst but the level is much higher this time. There is nowhere to sleep and the water came with sickness. With so many mosquitoes malaria is here. ""I am living with my family on the top level of the incomplete building. We have to use this contaminated water for washing and drinking."" Ms Otuaba said the displaced families had received no help from the government. ""The floodwater destroyed our store of food supplies from our family farm so we have nothing to feed on. The foundation of our house is also damaged. We do not know if it still will be standing after having so much water inside. ""But in our community we support each other. When there is food we share it. I have a degree in business studies, but I am not employed at present. I work on our family farm."" ""We were told that a flood is coming but we did not prepare for something of this magnitude, particularly because in this community flooding is rare,"" said farmer Prince Ogiasa Lume Otuoke (above). ""The flood came suddenly. There was no time for preparation as the water was overflowing with extreme force. I did not have the chance to dive into the water and save my crops.  ""Our main crop here is plantain, and for the planting we need the suckers. But they will have all rotted away under the floodwater."" According to the UN's disaster relief agency (Ocha), the flooding in Nigeria affected more than three million people. More than 600 people lost their lives and another 1.5 million people were forced to flee their homes. It extensively damaged houses, farms and basic infrastructure and decimated livelihoods across the country. ""The damage to staple foods such as cassava, rice, and plantain, among other crops, risks aggravating the already alarming food and nutrition crisis across Nigeria,"" said Ocha's Matthias Schmale. ""The experience was not easy. We have been moving from one place to another for shelter. We are now living in the upstairs of an incomplete building,"" said Iruaro Robert Otuaba, a school student (above right). ""We lost our personal belongings but I was most upset to see all my children's schoolbooks in the water,"" said his mother Edigiraru Donald (above left). ""All the crops from our farm are destroyed. We are seriously suffering now because I can't do any business to survive."" This is the outside of a church in Ogbia, showing how slow it was taking for the waters to recede. ""I remember the flood when 2012 when I was a boy, but that was not nearly as bad as this. Nobody in our community expected it to be this huge,"" said Mr Otuaba. For farmer Orubo Oro Tombia (above), from neighbouring Yenagoa municipality, the worst aspect has been the loss of cassava stems: ""It is a disaster to me in so many ways and the cause of so much stress. ""The farmland is submerged so all the stems are dead. That means there will be no crop in the coming year."" ""We know that many things caused this flood. A dam over the border in Cameroon released water, and our government has failed to prepare for this by building a dam to curtail it,"" she said. ""I also believe that climate change caused the unusual rains and the overflow of the dam. I have a canoe, so at least I am able to move around and return to my home."" Fidelia Shedrack Igbogene (above), also in Yenagoa, said her family were the only ones left on her street as they had an upper floor: ""Where we are here there is no comfort because the building is unfinished. Mosquitos feast on us. The situation is terrible and bad.  ""I make a living farming fish and we had two fishponds. They were washed away and I have lost all my fish."" ""I am a university student. Many of my academic books are damaged, and how can I study when I am living like this?"" said Winner Odums (above) in Ogbia. ""It's hard for my family to survive with food prices so high and all of our farm produce destroyed. With all the water still here it makes life unbearable."" Many people have been struggling to find refuge - this is Dorcas Apartments where only the upper levels were accessible. ""Someone gave us his place to stay but now he has just asked us to leave so we are now staying by the roadside,"" said Aruaman Ase in Ogbia. ""I work in a student building and most of their belongings under my watch as the apartment caretaker are gone, submerged under floodwaters,"" said Alawei Christian (above). ""This is my fourth experience of flooding, but it is much worse this time, the biggest of all of them. It has really affected my family. We have lost so much, including 25 chickens."" ""There has been some help offered, but not nearly enough,"" said Mr Christian. ""Imagine a bag of rice and beans for hundreds of people in the community. We received just a single cup measure of rice and beans."" Farmer Janet Eke Otuoke is sleeping at her brother's home in Ogbia: ""We are seven people in that small room with our children, living and managing together. ""I also lost all my cassava stems, so for us to plant next year it means we would need to buy them. But each stem goes for more than a 1,000 naira [$2.20, Â£1.75], which is far beyond our means.  ""My appeal to government is that they should help us to continue farming and also help with the properties that have been so damaged."" Interviews by Tife Owalabi and Stanley Boroh.

But soldiers have told the BBC they've pulled back in a controlled and tactical move before a planned counter-attack.  Long bursts of automatic gunfire rattled across the grey, stubbled fields on the front line between Soledar and the neighbouring town of Bakhmut, during an intense gun and artillery battle. ""It's quite close. One kilometre,"" said a tall Ukrainian unit commander named Andriy, peering around the corner of a ruined cottage and towards a dark line of trees to the east. It was impossible to be sure what was happening. But the sound of automatic gunfire, zinging overhead, in addition to the constant boom of rockets and artillery, suggested that Russian infantry were close. A press officer for the 46th Air Assault Brigade, who was accompanying us on a visit to the area, said the front lines were constantly shifting, unpredictably, sometimes by several kilometres a day. ""We have a tough situation here,"" Andriy acknowledged, before slipping into a well-disguised command bunker hidden amid the ruins. His team had just received detailed information about a Russian armoured personnel carrier (APC), spotted by a Ukrainian drone. Moments later, there were three loud outgoing blasts from a nearby UK-supplied light artillery piece, used here by Ukrainian forces, and aimed at the vehicle. ""Every day we destroy 50 or 100 enemy people,"" Andriy claimed. The fighting in and around Soledar has been some of the heaviest of the war, with Russian forces - spearheaded by the mercenaries and convicts of the Kremlin's Wagner group - reportedly suffering heavy losses but finally succeeding in taking control of the small hill-top town, now a wasteland of flattened buildings and rubble.  Privately, some Ukrainian soldiers have blamed poor co-ordination between different units for the loss of Soledar and have acknowledged that Russia may now be better placed to encircle the far bigger and strategically more important neighbouring town of Bakhmut, to the south. But the mood among front line units in villages like Paraskoviivka, now just a few hundred metres from Russian positions, appears to be quietly confident. Furious Ukrainian air and artillery bombardments appear to be blocking Russian attempts to move forward both from the north and from the south-western outskirts of Bakhmut. ""It's a controlled situation. I believe in my commander. Sometimes it's really better to take a step backâ¦ then after that to make a [counter] attack and crush the enemy. Each day we're destroying enemy positions,"" said Andriy. On a grey morning this week, a light thaw turned the snowbound country lanes on the northern edge of Bakhmut into muddy tracks. During winter there is precious little cover from trees and bushes, leaving many roads visible and vehicles exposed to Russian artillery fire.  As we took cover behind a small cottage, a shell crashed into the road 300m behind us. Our military escort said the fighting had reached a new pitch of intensity, with the boom of rockets and artillery fire coming every few seconds, amid the wail of sirens from Ukrainian ambulances whisking the wounded back to a field hospital. ""We have gun(shot) wounds, we have shrapnel wounds. The fighting here seems to be particularly intense. We also have (cases of) frostbite and flu. And people are tired,"" said Dr Andriy Zholob, the commander of the 46th Brigade's medical unit. But he insisted morale among the soldiers remained high. ""They're tired, they're cold, they're wounded. But they ask me, 'Doc, when can I return?' They don't want to say - 'I'm wounded, now I can relax.' Their hearts are burning still. We have work to do,"" said Dr Zholob, scrolling through a video showing him removing mortar shrapnel from a soldier's shoulder. Closer to Bakhmut, two Ukrainian jets roared overhead, as artillery and tanks, hidden in the fields, continued to pound Russian positions.  Â© 2023 BBC.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz is under increasing international and domestic pressure to supply German-built Leopard 2 tanks or at least approve their delivery by third countries.  Poland and Finland have both promised to send their Leopards - but need Germany's permission to do so.  But Berlin is still in talks with the US about its official position.  Many expect an announcement to follow a meeting of Ukraine's Western allies at the American military base of Ramstein in southwestern Germany tomorrow.  Reports suggest that Mr Scholz will only give the green light to the Leopards if the US President Joe Biden agrees to supply American Abrams tanks.  However, the Pentagon's top security adviser, Colin Kahl, said late on Thursday that the US wasn't prepared to meet Kyiv's demands for the tanks. ""The Abrams tank is a very complicated piece of equipment. It's expensive. It's hard to train on. It has a jet engine,"" Mr Kahl said. A senior German government source told the BBC that reports of a deadlock between Berlin and Washington over tanks were overstated, but they're causing concern amongst Ukraine's Western allies. The provision of Western battle tanks - in sufficient numbers - is widely seen as crucial if Ukraine is to defeat Russia or, at the very least, defend itself against Russian President Vladimir Putin's anticipated spring offensive.  Yet, to date, only Britain has promised to supply them. Other countries, including Germany, France and the US, have sent or pledged to send armoured vehicles as well as air defence systems and other heavy equipment. Meanwhile, Kyiv's demands for tanks are growing increasingly urgent.  So why is Mr Scholz dithering over their delivery?  All indications are that he will allow third countries to supply their Leopards - the German Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck said so a week or so ago.  But Mr Scholz has not yet committed. He's cautious for several reasons.  Germany worries - albeit less so than it did in the past - about escalation and how Russia's Vladimir Putin would react to the supply of offensive weapons. It's a reasoning which many experts perceive to be unjustified.  And the concept of German tanks on Ukrainian soil still resonates uncomfortably in Berlin, where the country's World War Two history still casts a long shadow.  Mr Scholz may have declared a ""Zeitenwende"" (sea-change) in Germany's stance on defence and military policy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but he's still mindful that, less than a year ago, the idea of the German government supplying arms to a conflict would have been unthinkable.  The Chancellor has his eye on the domestic opinion polls. As one senior government source put it to me, surveys suggest the public are broadly satisfied with his reaction to Ukraine - unlike his policies and performance in many other areas.  A recent survey for the national broadcaster found that 41% of the public thought Germany was supplying the right amount of weapons, 26% thought its support went too far and 25% that Germany wasn't sending enough.  Mr Scholz has promised that Germany will play a greater military role on the world stage, but years of underinvestment have left its armed forces in a parlous state.  Even if the Chancellor gives the green light to sending Leopards, the arms manufacturer Rheinmetall has warned that renovation and preparation requirements would delay their delivery by months.  Mr Scholz doesn't want to risk the perception that he's acting alone, hence the desire to co-ordinate with allies and, in particular, the US. And it's why there's unlikely to be an announcement ahead of the Ramstein meeting tomorrow.  But his position has triggered frustration and condemnation in international political and security circles.  They say Germany - still a political heavyweight - must step up to its military responsibilities. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The pair have been due to face each other twice before, but both bouts were called off. Jake has said he still has doubts their long-awaited face-off in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, will actually happen. But Tommy, who's just become a dad, told BBC Newsbeat: ""I've got my sole sight focused on Jake Paul."" The boxing pro - younger brother of world champion heavyweight Tyson Fury - said his training regime was ""rigorous"" and ""does not bode well"" for his opponent. ""By the time I get in the ring I'll be an absolute specimen and I'll be able to dismantle this man very quickly and very early,"" he said. Influencer Jake, who took up boxing three years ago, believes he can cause an upset at the match on 26 February. He accused Tommy of being ""the runt of the Fury family"" and a ""spray tanner"". And Jake said his opponent's focus would be off because Tommy's partner, Molly-Mae Hague, had just given birth.  When BBC Newsbeat spoke to Tommy on Saturday, the new arrival hadn't been officially announced. And he didn't want to discuss it or respond to the fact Jake had already revealed the big news.  Tommy did say family was ""far more important than a boxing match"" but insisted his personal life wasn't going to affect his training. Family aside, Tommy was much happier to share his predictions for the fight. ""There's no way this man can beat me,"" Tommy said. ""There's not a chance in the world.  ""Just because he's got 22 million followers on Instagram, that doesn't make it a 50-50 fight."" Responding to Jake's jibes about his famous relatives, Tommy said he feels ""no pressure"" because of the family name. But he did admit that, if he bags a win in Riyadh, he definitely won't be carrying on Tyson's family tradition of a post-fight song. ""I don't want to burst anybody's eardrums and you definitely don't want to hear me sing,"" he says.  There's been a bit of discomfort about the decision to hold the fight in Saudi Arabia. Like World Cup host country Qatar, it has strict laws and has been criticised for its human rights record. Tommy told Newsbeat that his management team handles the organisation side of things, and he's just looking forward to the fight. ""I don't care, I'd fight this man on the moon and fight him in the parking lot outside. I'm not really interested. If it's Saudi, I'm happy to be coming to Saudi, putting on a show for everybody,"" he said. Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube. Listen to Newsbeat  at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back.

Russell Cook, from Worthing, West Sussex, said he will run 39.1 miles (63km) every day, with no rest days.  The extreme challenge will begin on 5 February and is expected to take eight months. Mr Cook said following struggles with his mental health, gambling and drinking, he hopes to look back at his life and say, ""boy, we had a tear up"". The 25-year-old will run 9,320 miles (14,500km) during the challenge, crossing 16 borders - through cities, rainforests and a three-month stretch in the Sahara Desert. He highlighted the geopolitical issues in the ""lawless"" region, as well as a lack of resources for him and his three-person support crew.  ""Not many people live there, so in terms food, petrol and water, it's slim pickings,"" he said.  ""Then you've got the sheer fact it's boiling hot during the day, freezing cold at night and I'll be running on sand, which is an absolute killer."" The challenge, in aid of The Running Charity and Water Aid, will begin in Tunisia and finish in South Africa.

""I've grown here, spent most of my life here,"" he said. ""I'd love to put Worthing on the map in some kind of way.""

Kujtim Fejzulai went on the rampage in Vienna's busy nightlife area known as the Bermuda Triangle, shooting dead four people and wounding 23 others. His nine minutes of terror finally ended when he was shot dead by police. The men on trial were accused of helping him before the attack.  Two others aged 22 and 23 were found not guilty of being accomplices to murder but were convicted of lesser terror-related offences. The 20-year-old attacker, who had Austria and Macedonian nationality, had been radicalised in Austria and had served 18 months in jail for trying to join jihadist group Islamic State (IS), which said it was behind the murders.  The sentences were as follows: All have the right to appeal. For almost four decades, Vienna had escaped the kind of large-scale attacks that have hit European capitals such as Paris, London and Berlin.  That changed on 2 November 2020, when the gunman struck at the heart of the old city.  The area, with its narrow, cobbled streets, is home to Vienna's oldest church, St Ruprecht's, and to the city's main synagogue, the Stadttempl, the only Jewish house of worship to survive the Nazi Kristallnacht pogrom in 1938.   Quiet by day, at night it is one of Vienna's liveliest night spots. The shootings began at 8pm. It was a warm evening, and many people were enjoying a final night out, ahead of a coronavirus lockdown in Austria.  The morning after, the steps of one traditional old restaurant were smeared with blood. One man, who was having dinner there, described how he and his wife had taken refuge in the cellar there, when the shots rang out.   The interior ministry was strongly criticised for having failed to monitor the gunman even though they had been alerted to the danger.  The government, which admitted mishandling intelligence related to the attack, later brought in a heavily criticised anti-terror law, which allowed for increased surveillance and introduced a new offence of ""religiously motivated"" crimes.  Judges, rights groups and the opposition criticised the legislation. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

The study found that males travel long distances in search of mating partners, often giving up sleep in the process. A lack of rest may explain why males of the carnivorous marsupials typically mate themselves to death in one breeding season, experts say. Females, on the other hand, can live and reproduce for up to four years. ""They cover large distances to mate as often as possible and it seems that their drive is so strong that they forgo sleeping to spend more time searching for females,"" said  Christofer Clemente, senior lecturer at the University of the Sunshine Coast. His institution led the study with The University of Queensland. The research was published on Wednesday.  Researchers collected data over 42 days after fitting backpacks with trackers on wild roaming male and female northern quolls on Groote Eylandt, an island off the coast of Australia's Northern Territory.  Some quolls they studied walked more than 10km (6.2 miles) in one night, which translates to nearly 40km in human distance, based on average stride length, the study said. Males of the species also appeared to attract more parasites. The most likely reason: they devote less time to grooming so they can make the most of each breeding season. Researchers said the males are not as vigilant as females while searching for food or avoiding predators.  ""Sleep deprivation, and associated symptoms for a prolonged duration would make recuperation impossible and could explain the causes of death recorded in the males after breeding season,"" said Joshua Gaschk, the study's lead author. ""They become easy prey, are unable to avoid vehicle collisions, or simply die from exhaustion.""  Mr Gaschk added that the initial data points to the need for further studies on how sleep deprivation affects quolls and wider families of marsupial mammals found in Australia and Papua New Guinea. ""If male quolls forgo sleep to the detriment of their survival, northern quolls [will become] an excellent model species for the effects of sleep deprivation on body function,"" he said. According to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy, there are some 100,000 northern quolls remaining but the population has been ""undergoing rapid decline"". Loss of habitat due to development and attacks by stray cats pose a serious threat, and they are also particularly vulnerable to being poisoned by cane toads.  Â© 2023 BBC.

Konstantin Yefremov, the most senior officer to speak openly, told the BBC in an exclusive interview Russia now sees him as a traitor and defector. At one site in southern Ukraine, he said ""the interrogations, the torture, continued for about a week"".  ""Every day, at night, sometimes twice a day."" Mr Yefremov tried to resign from the army numerous times - but he ended up being dismissed for refusing to return to Ukraine. He has now fled Russia. Using photographs and military documents supplied by Mr Yefremov, the BBC has verified he was in Ukraine early in the war - in the Zaporizhzhia region, including the city of Melitopol. This article contains graphic descriptions of torture. Konstantin Yefremov's face flickers into view on my computer screen and we start to talk. He is a man with a story to tell. Until recently he was a Russian army officer.  Deployed to Ukraine last year, the former senior lieutenant has agreed to tell me about the crimes he says he witnessed there - including torture and mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners. He will talk about his comrades looting occupied areas of Ukraine, and describe brutal interrogation sessions, led by a Russian colonel, in which men were shot and threatened with rape. On 10 February 2022, Mr Yefremov says he arrived in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia nine years ago. He was the head of a de-mining unit of the 42nd Motorised Rifle Division - and was usually based in Chechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus. He and his men were sent to take part in ""military exercises"", he says.  ""At the time no-one believed there would be war. Everyone thought this was only a drill. I'm sure even senior officers didn't know."" Mr Yefremov recalls seeing Russian troops taping identification marks on their uniforms and painting the letter ""Z"" on military equipment and vehicles. Within days, ""Z"" had become the symbol of what the Kremlin was calling its ""special military operation"".  Mr Yefremov claims he wanted nothing to do with it.    ""I decided to quit. I went to my commander and explained my position. He took me to a senior officer who called me a traitor and a coward. ""I left my gun, got in a taxi and drove off. I wanted to return to my base in Chechnya and resign officially. Then my comrades telephoned me with a warning.  ""A colonel had promised to put me in prison for up to 10 years for desertion and he'd alerted the police."" Mr Yefremov says he called a military lawyer, who advised him to turn around.  ""I realise now I should have ignored that and driven on,"" he says. ""But I was afraid of being put in jail.""  He went back to join his men. Mr Yefremov insists he is ""anti-war"". He assures me he did not participate in Russia's annexation of Crimea, or fight in eastern Ukraine when war first erupted in the Donbas nine years ago.  In 2014, Russia was not only accused of orchestrating a separatist uprising there, but of sending in its own troops. Konstantin also tells me he has not taken part in Russia's military operation in Syria.  ""For the last three years I had been involved in mine clearance in Chechnya, a place that had experienced two wars. I think the work I've done there has benefited people."" Mr Yefremov was placed in temporary charge of a rifle platoon. On 27 February, three days after the Russian invasion, he says he and his men were ordered to move north from occupied Crimea. They headed for the city of Melitopol. The next 10 days were spent at an airfield which had already been captured by Russian troops. He describes the looting he witnessed. ""Soldiers and officers grabbed everything they could. They climbed all over the planes and went through all the buildings. One soldier took away a lawnmower. He said proudly, 'I'll take this home and cut the grass next to our barracks.'  ""Buckets, axes, bicycles, they bunged it all in their trucks. So much stuff they had to squat down to fit in the vehicles."" Mr Yefremov has sent us photographs he says he took at Melitopol air base. They show transport planes and a building on fire.  They are among a number of pictures and documents he has shared - and which we have verified - to confirm Mr Yefremov's identity, rank and his movements in Ukraine in the spring of 2022.  Online mapping tools confirmed the images of Melitopol air base. For a month and a half, he and eight soldiers under his command guarded a Russian artillery unit there. ""The whole time we slept outside,"" he recalls. ""We were so hungry we started hunting for rabbits and pheasants. One time we came across a mansion. There was a Russian fighter inside. 'We're with the 100th Brigade and we live here now,' the soldier said.  ""There was so much food. The fridges were packed. There was enough food to survive a nuclear war. But the soldiers living there were catching the Japanese carp in the pond outside and eating them."" Konstantin Yefremov's group moved to guard what he describes as a ""logistics headquarters"" in April - in the town of Bilmak, to the north-east of Melitopol. There, he says he witnessed interrogations and mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners. He recalls a day when three prisoners were brought in. ""One of them admitted to being a sniper. On hearing this, the Russian colonel lost his mind. He hit him, he pulled the Ukrainian's trousers down and asked if he was married.  ""'Yes,' the prisoner replied. 'Then someone bring me a mop,' said the colonel. 'We'll turn you into a girl and send your wife the video.'"" Another time, says Mr Yefremov, the colonel asked the prisoner to name all the Ukrainian nationalists in his unit. ""The Ukrainian didn't understand the question. He replied that the soldiers were naval infantry of the Ukrainian armed forces. For that answer they knocked out some of his teeth."" The Kremlin wants Russians to believe that, in Ukraine, Russia is fighting fascists, neo-Nazis and ultra-nationalists. This false narrative serves to dehumanise Ukrainians in the eyes of the Russian public and the military. Mr Yefremov says the Ukrainian prisoner had a blindfold on.  ""The colonel put a pistol to the prisoner's forehead and said 'I'm going to count to three and then shoot you in the head.'  ""He counted and then fired just to the side of his head, on both sides. The colonel started shouting at him. I said: 'Comrade colonel! He can't hear you, you've deafened him!'"" Mr Yefremov describes how the colonel gave orders that the Ukrainians shouldn't be given normal food - only water and crackers. But he says: ""We tried to give them hot tea and cigarettes.""  So that the prisoners didn't sleep on bare ground, Mr Yefremov also recalls how his men tossed them hay - ""at night, so that no-one saw us"".  During another interrogation, Mr Yefremov says the colonel shot a prisoner in the arm - and in the right leg under the knee, which hit the bone. Konstantin says his men bandaged the prisoner up and went to the Russian commanders - ""not to the Colonel, he was crazy"" - and said the prisoner needed to go to hospital, otherwise he would die from blood loss. ""We dressed him up in a Russian uniform and took him to hospital. We told him: 'Don't say you're a Ukrainian prisoner of war, because either the doctors will refuse to treat you, or the injured Russian soldiers will hear and shoot you and we won't be able to stop them."" The UN's Human Rights Office has been documenting cases of mistreatment of prisoners in the war in Ukraine. It has interviewed more than 400 POWs - both Ukrainians and Russians.  ""Unfortunately, we've found there is torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war happening on both sides,"" says Matilda Bogner, head of the UN's Ukraine-based monitoring team.  ""If we compare the violations, the torture or ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war tends to happen at almost every stage of confinement. And, for the most part, the conditions of internment are worse in many areas of Russia or occupied Ukraine."" The worst forms of torture or ill treatment for Ukrainian prisoners of war usually occur during interrogation, says Ms Bogner. They can be subjected to electrocution and a whole range of torture methods - she says - including hanging people up and beating them.  ""When they arrive at places of internment there are often so-called welcoming beatings. They also often face inadequate food and water,"" she adds. Russian prisoners of war, too, have reported beatings and suffering electrocution. ""Any form of torture or ill treatment is prohibited under international law,"" says Ms Bogner. ""It is unacceptable for either side to do this."" The BBC was unable to independently confirm Konstantin Yefremov's specific allegations of torture, but they are consistent with other claims of abuse of Ukrainian prisoners. Russia's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr Yefremov would eventually return to his de-mining unit, but not for long. ""Seven of us had taken the decision [to leave the army],"" he tells me. At the end of May, back in Chechnya, he wrote his letter of resignation. Some senior officers were not happy.  ""They started threatening me. Officers who hadn't spent a day in Ukraine were telling me that I was a coward and a traitor. They wouldn't allow me to resign. I was dismissed."" Mr Yefremov shows us letters from the military. In the first document, he is accused of ""shirking his duties"" and disregarding an order to return to Ukraine. It is described as ""a serious breach of discipline"". The second letter refers to Mr Yefremov's ""early dismissal from military serviceâ¦ for breaking his contract"". ""After 10 years of service I was denounced as a traitor, a defector, just because I didn't want to kill people,"" he says. ""But I was glad that I was now a free person, that I wouldn't have to kill or be killed.""  Mr Yefremov was out of the army. But not out of danger of being sent back to the war. In September 2022, President Putin declared what he called ""partial mobilisation"". Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens would be drafted into the military and sent to Ukraine. Mr Yefremov says he knew - because he had already served with the military in Ukraine - he would not be left alone. He came up with an escape plan. ""In the house where I was living I made a hatch in the attic ceilingâ¦ in case police and enlistment officers broke in to deliver call-up papers.  ""Enlistment officers were driving to my house and waiting for me in their cars. So, I rented a flat and hid there.  ""I hid from the neighbours, too, because I'd heard of cases when neighbours told police about young men who'd been drafted and were hiding. I found this situation humiliating and unacceptable.""   Mr Yefremov contacted Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, which helped him leave Russia.   What does Mr Yefremov think about those Russians - and there are many - who express support for Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine? ""I don't know what's going on in their heads,"" he says. ""How could they allow themselves to be fooled? When they go to market, they know they could be short-changed. They don't trust their wives, their husbands.  ""But the man who has been deceiving them for 20 years, he only has to give the word and these people are ready to go and kill and die. I can't understand it."" As we end our chat, Mr Yefremov says sorry to the people of Ukraine. ""I apologise to the entire Ukrainian nation for coming to their home as an uninvited guest with a weapon in my hands. ""Thank God I didn't hurt anyone. I didn't kill anyone. Thank God I wasn't killed.  ""I don't even have the moral right to ask for forgiveness from the Ukrainians. I can't forgive myself, so I can't expect them to forgive me."" Producer: Will Vernon Open source analysis: Joshua Cheetham With help from Gulagu.net Follow Steve Rosenberg on Twitter Â© 2023 BBC.

Asked on Monday if the US would be sending the planes, Mr Biden said ""no"". The UK also said it was ""not practical"" for it to send its aircraft to Ukraine. France's Emmanuel Macron said ""by definition, nothing is excluded"" ahead of meeting a Ukrainian minister. Ukraine says advanced jets will help protect its skies from Russian attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the country's top military officials say there should be no taboos on such military aid - but the US and its partners fear this would lead to further escalation with a nuclear-armed Russia.  On Tuesday, Ukraine's Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat was quoted by the Ukrainska Pravda news website as saying that Kyiv needed up to 200 multi-role fighter jets - such as F-16s - to defend its skies.  He said that Russia currently outnumbered Ukraine by five to six times in terms of the number of war planes. The US-made F-16s would be a significant upgrade on the Soviet-era fighting jets - mostly MiGs - Ukraine is currently using, which were made before the country declared independence from the USSR in 1991. However, Mr Biden has repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine's pleas for the jets, instead focussing on providing military support in other areas. Other Western allies have been been less definitive though. On Monday, President Macron did not rule out sending its war planes to Ukraine - but he stressed that it must neither further inflame the situation nor limit France's ability to defend itself.  Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov is now in Paris, where he is expected to discuss the issue with Mr Macron and French military officials later on Tuesday. Poland - another key ally of Ukraine - has also not ruled out sending F-16s to Kyiv. However, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said any such move would only be possible ""in complete co-ordination"" with other Nato members. The US announced last week it would supply Kyiv with 31 Abrams tanks, reversing its earlier stance on the issue. The UK and Germany also pledged similar support. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Andriy Melnyk welcomed that announcement but asked allies for the creation of a ""fighter jet coalition"" that would also provide Ukraine with Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets. On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman said he was not aware of any formal request from Ukraine for aircraft, adding that ""the UK's Typhoon and F-35 jets are extremely sophisticated and take months to learn how to fly"".  ""Given that we believe it is not practical to send those jets to Ukraine."" However, the spokesperson said Mr Sunak ""has had intensive discussions with military advisers"" and ""the conclusion is that given Russia's advantage in numbers a sustained war of attrition would not benefit Ukraine"". Germany has also said it will not send fighter jets to Ukraine.  The F-16 Fighting Falcon is widely considered one of the world's most reliable fighter jets and is used by other countries, such as Belgium and Pakistan.  It can be armed with precision-guided missiles and bombs and is able to fly at 1,500 mph (2,400 km/h), according to the US Air Force.  The F-16's targeting capabilities would allow Ukraine to attack Russian forces in all weather conditions and at night with greater accuracy. Moscow has repeatedly accused Nato of being an aggressor by proxy, warning that further escalation could trigger a nuclear war.

Last year, the population in China fell for the first time in 60 years. For decades, the country had a one-child policy - increased nationally for married couples to three in 2021. As part of the policy change in Sichuan, unmarried individuals will also now be able to raise children. Previously there was a ban on single women registering a birth. In 2016, China scrapped its controversial one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979. Families that broke the rules were fined and, in some cases even lost jobs.  In a culture that historically favours boys over girls, the policy also led to forced abortions. But the changes that began in 2016 failed to halt the decline in the birth rate. Deaths outnumbered births for the first time last year in China. Now, there will be no limit on the number of children people can have in Sichuan, a province of 80 million people in the south west of the country. Chinese President Xi Jinping has made boosting birth rates a priority. The government has offered tax breaks and better maternal healthcare to reverse or slow the falling rates.  It comes as China is still battling Covid-related deaths throughout the country. The virus tore through towns and cities after the lifting of zero-Covid restrictions in December. Neighbouring countries, including Japan, are also facing falling birth rates. Japan's prime minister says, as a result, his country is on the brink of not being able to function as a society.

The 74-year-old was convicted in 2019 of ordering the extrajudicial execution of 15 political opponents four decades ago.  Bouterse has since been appealing against this ruling and cannot be arrested until the process ends. The court is expected to rule on the sentence later this year. Bouterse has denied involvement in the executions. He insists the victims - who included lawyers, union leaders and journalists - were shot while trying to escape a colonial-era fortress in Paramaribo, the capital of the South American country. An appeal hearing for the former leader is currently under way and is expected to last until the end of March, after which time the High Court will announce its decision on the sentence.  Bouterse recently admitted in court that he had heard gunshots on the day the prisoners were killed but insisted he did not order their execution.  He has instead blamed his deputy, Paul Bhagwandas - who died in 1996 - for the deaths. But witnesses testified that Bouterse was present when the victims were killed.  The killings took place in 1982 - seven years after Suriname's independence from the Netherlands. Lawyers for Bouterse have previously argued that the victims were collaborating with the Dutch, France and the US to depose him. Bouterse led Suriname during the 1980s as head of a military government and de facto leader. He took office as president in 2010, following a democratic election and was elected for another term in 2015 He remained in the post until 2020, when his party lost power. Â© 2023 BBC.

Mr Pavel, a retired Nato general, said Ukraine would be ""morally and practically ready"" to join the Western alliance once the conflict had ended.  In his first broadcast interview with the international media since his election, Gen Pavel gave a robust defence of Western military support to Kyiv, saying there should be ""almost no limits"" to what countries should send.   Speaking from the renaissance Hrzansky Palace, a few hundred metres from Prague Castle, he said for him sending Western fighter planes such as F-16s was ""not taboo"", but he was unsure they could be delivered in a timeframe that could prove useful to Kyiv.  US President Joe Biden has ruled out sending F-16s this week, although France's Emmanuel Macron has said nothing is excluded. ""I am proud of my country being one of the first to provide Ukraine with significant military help,"" he told the BBC.   The Czech Republic was the first Western country to send tanks and infantry fighting vehicles - Soviet-designed T72s and BMP1s - to Kyiv, part of a series of deliveries of heavy weapons that reportedly began as early as March 2022.  Almost a year on, after much agonising and soul-searching, countries including the UK, the United States and Germany have begun answering Kyiv's repeated calls to send modern, Western-made tanks such as Leopard 2s, Challenger 2s and M1 Abrams.   ""Probably very few people could imagine that Western countries would be willing to provide Ukraine with modern main battle tanks or long-range artillery or anti-aircraft systems,"" he went on.  Now, he said, it was reality.   ""But at the same time we see it's still not enough"" to counter Russia's significant resources of men and materiel, he added.  He acknowledged Kyiv's disappointment at the speed of deliveries, especially Western tanks, which were explicitly designed to punch holes - literally and figuratively - through Soviet armoured formations.  Ukraine has asked for 300 such tanks and says the West has so far promised to send at least 120. But Gen Pavel said he hoped that would speed up - especially if Russia launches its anticipated spring offensive.   The president-elect brushed aside the view - long held in some European capitals, especially Berlin - that such deliveries could be seen as ""escalation"".  Russia has warned that increased supplies of Western weapons will lead to Nato countries increasingly becoming directly involved in the conflict. ""We have no alternative,"" he said. ""If we leave Ukraine without assistance, they would most probably lose this war. And if they lose - we all lose.""  President-elect Pavel also said that he and other European leaders had a duty to explain to their sceptical - and in many cases frightened populations - of the sense in helping Ukraine.  ""Our cities are not being destroyed by Russian artillery and missiles. But our future could be destroyed if we don't support Ukraine to a successful end to this conflict.""  And he also dismissed claims - among them from the man who stood against him this weekend, former Prime Minister Andrej Babis - that he was closing the door to diplomacy.  ""Once there is even the slightest chance of peace talks, let's support it. But there are no signs of it from the Russian side,"" said Mr Pavel, who was often portrayed as a warmonger during the campaign.  ""What needs to be said is this: the end of war is entirely in Russian hands. It would take only one decision from President Putin to withdraw his forces from Ukraine and the war is over.""  And once it was over, he told the BBC, he could see a clear place for Ukraine in Nato.  ""The Ukrainian military will be probably the most experienced military in Europe. Ukraine deserves to be part of a community of democratic countries.""     Including Nato? I asked.  ""I believe they really deserve it.""  Â© 2023 BBC.

It is the latest European country to say it is increasing military spending as a result of the conflict. Poland has a military budget of just less than 2.5% of its GDP, but the prime minister says he wants to increase the figure to 4% this year.  Last week, Mateusz Morawiecki urged Germany to allow his country to export Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine. ""The war in Ukraine makes us arm ourselves even faster. That is why this year we will make an unprecedented effort: 4% of GDP for the Polish army,"" Mr Morawiecki said. Raising defence spending to 4% ""might mean that this will be the highest percentage... among all Nato countries,"" he added. Poland, which borders the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, has previously said it was buying 116 Abrams tanks from the US with the first deliveries to start this spring. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led many Western countries to review their military spending - and in many cases, increase it significantly. Members of the Nato Western military alliance have agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP, a measure of a country's economic output, on defence from 2024. The figure of 2% has been a long-standing target for the alliance. Recently, France outlined plans for a major boost to its armed forces in part due to the war in Ukraine, saying the next seven-year budget would increase to â¬413bn (Â£360bn) from 2024-30, up from â¬295bn. Sweden and Finland have announced steep increases in their military budgets as part of their bid to join Nato.  Days after the invasion in February 2022, Germany pledged an extra â¬100bn of the budget to the armed forces.  And in June, the UK promised under former prime minister Boris Johnson to increase spending to 2.5% of GDP.

He was seen hugging supporters and being driven away from Tehran's notorious Evin prison on Friday. Mr Panahi, 62, was arrested last July when he protested against the detention of two fellow filmmakers, who had been critical of the authorities. His wife told the BBC he was told he had an outstanding jail term to serve. Tahereh Saeedi said at the time that his detention - several months before the ongoing anti-government protests erupted - amounted to a kidnapping. Mr Panahi has won many awards at international film festivals. They include the Berlin International Film Festival's top prize, the Golden Bear, for Taxi in 2015, as well as the Best Screenplay prize at the Cannes Film Festival, for Three Faces in 2018. The Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux expressed ""great relief"" over the film maker's release.

The annual keynote speech, delivered as part of a primetime extravaganza, often attracts the largest audience a US president will receive all year - and everybody in town wants in on the action. A sentence here could inspire support for a lawmaker's pet project; a paragraph there could help take a government programme off the chopping block. Cody Keenan knows this all too well. As director of speechwriting in Barack Obama's second term, he was the principal penman behind four State of the Unions. ""It's the biggest speech you'll write all year, but it's also the most frustrating and annoying and time consuming,"" he says. ""You still feel a sense of pride and relief when it's all over with,"" he adds. President Biden's first State of the Union last March came only five days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. His second, on Tuesday, will be before a new Congress in which Republicans control one chamber. That likely means the speech will take on a much different tone from last year's one, but Mr Keenan argues it should nevertheless pick up from the core message left behind by Mr Biden in his 2022 State of the Union. He says the yearly address is like a ""built-in reset"" to the presidential calendar, because it is delivered near the start of the year and many people who don't follow politics daily tune in to listen. Under Mr Obama, Mr Keenan would begin working on the speech at least a month or two in advance, locking himself inside his windowless workroom beneath the Oval Office for hours on end as the date drew closer. His office had a coffee maker, gifted to him by National Security Council aides keen to get an item added to the speech one year. Some West Wing staffers even staked out the bathroom closest to his office and appealed to him for additions when they saw him come out, he recalls. Ignoring these entreaties, as well as his swelling email inbox, Mr Keenan and his assistant Susannah Jacobs came up with a system: a big smiley face emoji on his door if the speech was going well and he was open to additions, but a skull and crossbones up if the draft was in rough shape and needed no more cooks.  And while Mr Keenan was the lead writer, he always had help - from the remaining half a dozen or so speechwriters on the team, the chief of staff and of course the president himself. ""The real chief speechwriter was always Barack Obama, whether it was the State of the Union or any other big speech,"" says Terry Szuplat, who helped craft nearly 500 Obama speeches between 2009-17. ""One of the great myths of speechwriting is that it's somehow speechwriters putting words into the president's mouth and it's just the opposite.  ""It's speechwriters listening [to] and learning [from] the president every single day, and trying as best we can to provide a draft that captures their voice, vision and values."" Mr Szuplat argues that the State of the Union is a challenge few of these unheralded wordsmiths ever truly relish, a speech that must be given and is inherently high-profile but is rarely ever memorable. ""There's so many items to be addressed that every speechwriter does their best to pull it together in a coherent narrative with a common theme that brings everything together, but it's just so difficult when you're talking about truly everything - a state of the union,"" the rhetorical handyman says. Ahead of the speech, Mr Obama would sit down with his lead writers and establish an overarching theme for the address. Thereafter, various officials across the government would be called upon to provide their input, grounding the speech in a list of political realities and fiscal constraints. The core writing team would then sort through that list, prioritising certain items and dropping others. ""What makes a great State of the Union is lifting it up out of a list of initiatives, programmes and policies, and trying to offer a coherent, compelling story and vision to the American people,"" says Mr Szuplat. Officials in the last White House administration have rarely commented on what it was like writing speeches for President Donald Trump. But, according to the New York Times, speech-writing protocols for Mr Trump's State of the Unions hewed fairly close to Obama-era traditions: assembled with the input of various aides, edited by chief speechwriter Stephen Miller and touted as ""100 percent President Trump's own words"". President Biden is notoriously hard to write speeches for, often tinkering with multiple drafts until the last moment and frequently going off script. His chief speechwriter, Vinay Reddy, was praised last year by an administration official as being ""fluent in Bidenese"". Mr Reddy is expected to huddle this weekend with Mr Biden at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, to craft and hone a final draft. They will be joined by other senior White House aides as well as historian Jon Meacham.  As a showdown looms with Republicans over the federal debt limit, a justice department investigation into Mr Biden's handling of classified information and the anticipated launch of his re-election campaign, they will have to strike the right balance on Tuesday night. Or as Mr Keenan quips: ""Good luck to the speechwriters. I'm glad I'm not the one doing it."" Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The dish typically contains a mixture of fried potato and egg, often with onion, and is one of Spain's most widely eaten foods. Casa Dani is known for only lightly cooking the eggs, serving a particularly runny version. It closed temporarily after at least 59 people complained of food poisoning, having eaten tortilla there last week. Six have been hospitalised, according to the Madrid region's health department.  Casa Dani says it is co-operating with the local health authorities to ensure its kitchens are salmonella-free and can open again soon.  It has won a number of prizes, including the 2019 Spanish potato tortilla championship, and featured in the Netflix foodie series Somebody Feed Phil. It serves around 100,000 tortillas each year.  The case has put under scrutiny how restaurants prepare this dish and the regulations governing the cooking of eggs. For the last three decades, government guidelines have meant that eggs served to the public either have to be pasteurised or, if fresh, cooked through at a temperature of at least 75C.  In December 2022, a government decree slightly loosened those rules, stating that fresh eggs should be cooked through at ""70C or more for two seconds"" or ""at a temperature of 63C for 20 seconds"".  These temperatures are important: egg white sets at around 62-65C and egg yolk at 65-70C.  ""We put a thermometer into the tortilla, and we leave it cooking at 70 degrees for about two minutes and that kills all the bacteria,"" says Alfredo GarcÃ­a, owner of Sylkar restaurant in Madrid, which specialises in the dish. ""At 70 degrees it's still runny."" MarÃ­a del Toro, of the La Rioja Centre for Biomedical Research (CIBIR), told La COPE radio station that ""we all like [a runny tortilla] but it has more risk, especially for children, pregnant women and elderly people"".  The regional government of Madrid has also offered its own advice on the matter, warning that the summer is particularly propitious for salmonella in tortillas.  ""This happens when fresh eggs are used, the centre of the tortilla does not set and the cooked tortilla is left at room temperature for more than two hours before being consumed,"" the local government says on its website.  These guidelines advise against cleaning eggs before putting them in the fridge and against breaking eggs on the plate used for preparing them, to avoid contamination.  They also advise using pasteurised eggs, as opposed to fresh eggs, if making a runny tortilla.  However, 90% of customers in Sylkar restaurant prefer a runny tortilla with fresh eggs, Mr GarcÃ­a says - although he admits that the Casa Dani case has pushed many diners to request that it be more cooked than normal in recent days.  But he points out that preferences regarding the solidity or liquidity of tortilla are also influenced by geography.  ""South of Madrid, people prefer them much more set,"" he says. ""In Andalusia, tortillas are like bricks. In northern Spain, tortillas tend to be much less set, much more liquid.""  The tortilla has long been a battleground for differing tastes over another issue: whether or not to cook it with onion.  ""If you're one of those who uses onion, switch off now,"" warned Dani GarcÃ­a, owner of Casa Dani, in a recent cooking video.  But the veteran TV chef Karlos ArguiÃ±ano takes a different view.  ""Tortilla without onion is champion of Europe,"" he said recently. ""But tortilla with onion is champion of the world.""   Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The first people to greet Pope Francis when he arrived in the South Sudanese capital were Archbishop Justin Welby and Moderator Rev Iain Greenshields, who both boarded the papal plane moments after it landed. All three religious leaders were greeted with fanfare at Juba's airport before travelling through singing, cheering and ululating crowds to the Presidential Palace. ""It is a circuitous journey, yet one that can no longer be postponed,"" said Pope Francis, referring to delays in the trip caused by Covid, security concerns and the pontiff's own health problems. ""I have come with two brothers, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Together, stretching out our hands, we present ourselves to you and to this people in the name of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace,"" the Pope said. But this trip comes at a time when long-term peace and stability in South Sudan seem a distant prospect. It's people are suffering crushing poverty and have little hope in their political leaders. The youngest nation of the world has been ravaged by a bloody civil war since its leaders disagreed over control of the oil-rich country in 2013, just two years after its independence from Sudan. More than 400,000 people are thought to have died as a result of the conflict and though a peace deal in 2018 created a unity government, some of its key provisions have not been implemented. More than 60% of the population of South Sudan is estimated to be Christian, mainly belonging to Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian traditions, though the war has been fought along ethnic and not religious lines. The battle for control mainly raged between the supporters of President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and supporters of the First Vice-President Riek Machar, a Nuer.  Despite the deal, and the fact that they are working together, relations between the two men remain strained and there appears to be a lack of trust. Violence continues in parts of the country driven by ethnic tensions as well as a splinter group from Mr Machar's party - at least 20 people were killed during a cattle raid on the eve of the religious leaders' visit. In 2019, in one of the most dramatic moments of his papacy, Pope Francis kissed the feet of the leaders at the end of a retreat at the Vatican, at a time when it looked like the fragile peace agreement was about to collapse. This video can not be played Pope Francis appealed for peace after kissing the rival leaders' feet in 2019 It was then that a commitment was made for the three Christian leaders to visit South Sudan.  ""Pope Francis knelt to kiss the feet of each politician. Almost five years later, we come to you in this way again: on our knees to wash feet, to listen, serve and pray with you,"" Archbishop Welby said in Juba. There is considerable anticipation in South Sudan at what is a sensitive time. ""After the 2019 retreat, our political leaders made a pledge that they will never take the country back to war,"" said Father James Oyet Latansio, general-secretary of the South Sudan Council of Churches. Fr Oyet referred to the visit as an ""ecumenical pilgrimage of peace"" and feels the three religious leaders are uniquely placed to influence South Sudan's politicians, most of whom are church-going Christians: Mr Kiir, a Catholic and Mr Machar, Presbyterian. ""It will be a strong voice, a moral voice calling on the leaders of South Sudan telling them: 'Please now, give the people of South Sudan the peace they deserve,'"" Fr Oyet said. In an ugly, bloody battle for control of resources that morality has often been devastatingly absent. ""We are a majority Christian country, but what we are practising is not in keeping with Christian values,"" said Father John Gbemboyo Mbikoyezu of the Sudan and South Sudan Catholic Bishops' Conference. ""The conflict has brought so many brutal experiences to the people, it affects the spiritual life of the people and battles their hope and their trust in God,"" he said. Fr Gbemboyo said he was looking for a message of peace from the three visiting religious leaders but he, like Fr Oyet, also wants the Pope to directly tell South Sudan's leaders to focus on implementing peace for the sake of the country's people. With the capital's notoriously pot-holed roads fixed and the way that Juba has been spruced up, there is no doubt about the significance the leaders attach to this visit. It is intended that there will be joyful, celebratory moments through the trip. The BBC has been told 300 choir members and 70 altar dancers have been rehearsing for months. During the papal Mass in Juba, choir master Angelo Filberto Mussa says they will perform songs composed by South Sudanese. ""I am so happy the Pope is visiting us since we have been having a lot of issues. His coming will actually change a lot,"" said Deborah Yar Juma, a member of the congregation of the Anglican Church of South Sudan and a student at the University of Juba. ""When someone like the Pope comes and talks about peace, there is a hope that they [South Sudan's political leaders] will implement it."" But there has also, for many years, been frustration in South Sudan directed at global churches that had been keen to support the creation of the state, but once that had been achieved, did not follow through with adequate support in helping build civil society and political institutions. Frustration too in some quarters, that South Sudan's church leaders have not been strong enough advocates for peaceful co-existence among all South Sudanese. ""Churches both locally and globally failed in their moral responsibility to infuse doses of morality into political life in South Sudan,"" said Lino Nyaro Ungom, a former high school teacher and community activist in Juba. ""Moral decadence led to rampant corruption and conflict that led to loss of innocent lives and displacement of millions. ""If the churches had a strong voice, they would have challenged the politicians who are faithful in their churches and violence could have been prevented."" The Pope, Archbishop and Moderator suggest it is precisely that voice that they want to raise in South Sudan now, and that they will not hesitate in speaking frankly to South Sudan's political leaders. ""We need leaders who care about the values by which our countries live, who care about the conditions in which people live, and who act out their faith in work amongst the most vulnerable and marginalised. These things make for peace,"" said Rev Ian Greenshields, Moderator of the Church of Scotland, at Juba's Presidential Palace. But in a country where poverty and food insecurity is rife, flooding has caused so much devastation, aid has been cut from some of the very countries, including the UK, that supported its creation, and where ethnic disputes have deepened, there are many obstacles to lasting progress.

""We are seeing more and more reserves being deployed in our direction,"" said Serhiy Haidai, who expected a three-pronged Russian advance. Ukraine has warned repeatedly of an imminent offensive. But there is widespread scepticism of significant Russian success. The UK's defence intelligence briefing said Russia's aim was almost certainly to capture parts of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that were not already under occupation. But the UK said ""it remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war within the coming weeks"". Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said seven Ukrainians towns had been ""liberated"" in recent weeks and operations were progressing ""with success"" in two more, Bakhmut and Vuhledar. For six months, Russian mercenaries -now joined by regular troops - have tried to capture Bakhmut, a small city with a pre-war population of 70,000.  Now a Ukrainian commander, Denis Yaroslavskiy, has said only 2,000 civilians remain and Russian forces have captured parts of the east and north of the city and continue to move forward. The head of Russia's Wagner mercenary force said this week that Ukrainian forces were not in retreat anywhere in the city and fierce battles were taking place for every street, house and stairwell. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the military was paying close attention to Russia's attempt to encircle Bakhmut. ""We are countering them,"" he said on Monday night. He announced that leaders with military experience were being appointed in border and front-line regions, who could ""prove themselves"" against current threats from Russia. Ukrainian forces said on Tuesday they had shot down a Russian combat aircraft over Bakhmut, but there was no independent confirmation.  Russian forces have made little progress in Ukraine since their retreat from the major southern city of Kherson last November. Last month they captured the town of Soledar north of Bakhmut after an intense battle. Almost a year into Russia's invasion, an estimated 300,000 Russian reserve troops have been recruited in recent months in an attempt to break through Ukraine's front lines in the east. Capturing Bakhmut could enable Russian forces to press on towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. Mr Haidai said the Russians' two-month training period was coming to an end and Moscow would need around 10 days to transfer them to the front for a new offensive. He suggested that in Luhansk region they would target three towns: Bilohorivka, Kreminna and Svatove. President Zelensky has appealed to Western countries to hurry sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine to help Ukraine repel Russia's expected offensive. The US agreed last week to send long-range missiles that will enable Ukraine to double its attack range. The Russian defence minister warned that Western heavy weapons were drawing Nato countries into the conflict and ""could lead to an unpredictable level of its escalation"". Â© 2023 BBC.

The case sparked an outcry and calls for legal reform in South Korea, after police failed to act adequately on the victim's repeated complaints. Jeon Joo-hwan, 31, was convicted of stabbing the woman to death in a subway restroom in central Seoul last year. A Seoul court on Tuesday said it had been a ""revenge killing"". Jeon, a subway worker, had become obsessed with his 28-year-old female co-worker, stalking and threatening her over two years, the court heard. He called his colleague more than 300 times, begging her to date him and threatening to harm her if she refused. Despite a police investigation and a request to the courts for him to be detained, he was never imprisoned or given a restraining order. Authorities viewed him as ""low-risk"". He was eventually charged and convicted of stalking. On 14 September, the day before he was due in court to be sentenced on those offences, he tracked down the woman at her work shift in a central Seoul subway station and murdered her in the public bathroom. ""From the defendant's testimony, it appeared he was determined to murder the victim unless she agreed to settle,"" the Seoul District Central Court said in its verdict, according to Yonhap news agency. The court heard that Jeon believed the woman owed him damages as he had lost his subway job after she reported him to authorities. The court on Wednesday also ruled against the prosecutor's demands for a death penalty for Jeon, stating that his young age meant he could still reflect on his crimes and atone for them. In the aftermath of the murder, there were calls to strengthen South Korea's stalking law, which carries a clause stating that perpetrators can only be prosecuted with the consent of victims. Critics argued this made it too easy for victims to be bullied into withdrawing their cases. South Korea's justice ministry has agreed to remove the clause, but the bill is yet to pass parliament. A fortnight ago, lawyers representing victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence called on lawmakers to pass the bill urgently. They cited the case of another woman who had been recently stabbed by her stalker. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

On a visit to one of the worst-hit regions, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the official death toll in Turkey had climbed to 9,057. The main opposition leader has blamed him for the scale of the devastation. But Mr Erdogan hit back, saying it was ""not possible"" to be prepared for such a big disaster. Many in the worst affected areas have have criticised the response by the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) for being too slow. Others say the government was not sufficiently prepared in advance. ""If there is one person responsible for this, it is Erdogan,"" said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey's main opposition party. The president rejected this. He also described those who said they had not seen security forces at all in some areas as ""provocateurs"". ""This is a time for unity, solidarity. In a period like this, I cannot stomach people conducting negative campaigns for political interest,"" he told reporters in Hatay. During another stop on his tour of areas in the disaster zone earlier today, he acknowledged some initial problems, but said the situation was now ""under control"". In the southern Turkish port of Iskenderun on Tuesday, Arzu Dedeoglu said two of her nieces were trapped under the rubble. Her family had arranged a digger with their own resources to remove the debris, but she said officials did not allow them to use it.  ""We waited till late in the evening, but nobody came,"" Ms Dedeoglu said. ""We brought in a caterpillar (digger) with our own means, but they did not want us to use it - they stopped us. We have two kids under the rubble: my sister's daughters, AyÅegÃ¼l and Ä°layda.  ""They are gone now, they are gone."" When emergency services eventually arrived, Ms Dedeoglu yelled that they were ""too late"". Rescue workers paused for a moment, but the girls' family begged them not to stop. ""Please don't leave - maybe my kids are still alive,"" said their mother. Mr Erdogan has announced a three-month state of emergency in 10 provinces worst-affected by an earthquake. It will end just before elections on 14 May, when the 68-year-old will attempt to stay in power after 20 years. His main opposition is an alliance of centre-left and right-wing parties, known as the Table of Six. Mr Kilicdaroglu is expected to be the presidential candidate. In a video posted on Twitter, he vowed not to meet the president ""on any platform"", accusing the government of conducting ""PR work"" since the quakes.  Anger is also mounting over an ""earthquake tax"" levied by the Turkish government in the wake of a massive quake in 1999 that killed more than 17,000 people. The estimated 88bn lira ($4.6bn; Â£3.8bn) was meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services. Questions about the ""special communication tax"" - as the authorities call it - are asked every time there is an earthquake in Turkey. But the government has never publicly explained how the money is spent. And Mr Kilicdaroglu said Mr Erdogan's government ""has not prepared for an earthquake for 20 years"". But it is not just the president's main political rival who is voicing anger at the government's lack of preparedness.  ""Where have all our taxes gone, collected since 1999?"" Celal Deniz, 61, told the AFP news agency in the city of Gaziantep. His brother and nephews remain trapped under rubble. Social media users have also criticised some Turkish mainstream and pro-government news channels for ""muting"" criticisms by people in affected areas. Videos have been shared showing an NTV correspondent in Kahramanmaras saying locals were complaining that ""aid is inadequate"", with residents heard in the background asking: ""Where is the state?""  The channel then appears to cut the correspondent short before returning to the studio. Another video shared online showed a survivor telling a reporter on mainstream Haberturk network that ""no one has come"" to rescue them for days. The reporter subsequently moves away from the survivor and says rescuers have been ""looking everywhere"". Speaking in Kahramanmaras, Mr Erdogan acknowledged there had been difficulties with the initial response to the disaster, but blamed the delays on damaged roads and airports.  He said people should only listen to communication from authorities and ignore ""provocateurs"".  He is also scheduled to visit Hatay and Pazarcik, epicentre of the quake. ""The state is doing its job,"" he said.  But for many in Iskenderun, the state arrived too late. ""Why didn't you come yesterday, we were still hearing voices from the rubble yesterday!"" one woman shouted at rescue workers on Tuesday.  Another woman was in tears. ""We could have saved them if you'd arrived yesterday,"" she said. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

The night before, they had received a tip-off - the question paper for an examination to recruit teachers in the state's government schools was going to be leaked in the morning, just hours before millions of students were to take the test. Some 1,193 exam centres were set up for the eagerly-awaited recruitment drive on 24 December.  In India, where government jobs are highly coveted, cases of aspiring candidates resorting to unfair means are not uncommon. One way many job-seekers try to secure a place is by cheating in exams, which includes buying question papers or paying someone else to write the test on their behalf.  The bus in Udaipur was on its way to an examination centre and police suspected that those leaking the paper were on it.  At first, they waited at a distance as the bus circled around a building for a few minutes. Then they stopped it.   ""Inside, we found four government school teachers who were solving question papers for at least 20 candidates,"" an official, who wished to stay anonymous, told the BBC.   The aspirants had allegedly paid the teachers, who were on invigilation duty at the centre, money - the police did not specify how much - to solve the papers for them. Around 20 ""dummy"" candidates, who were paid by aspirants to take the test on their behalf, were also caught from the bus. Police alleged the accused were carrying fake IDs.  A total of 48 people were arrested in connection with the scam that morning, prompting authorities to cancel the examination process.  Two of the main accused are yet to be caught - authorities have announced a bounty of $1,500 (Â£1,245) on each of them, Udaipur police chief Vikas Sharma told the BBC. The incident was the latest in a series of scams where question papers for crucial government exams have been leaked or solved in exchange for money. Since 2018, at least 12 recruitment drives have been cancelled in the state after the test was leaked - just days, sometimes hours, before the exam.  Aspiring students say they are frustrated by the delays and are beginning to lose faith in the recruitment process. ""I don't think I will come again for the test,"" says Santosh Kumawat, the 30-year-old mother who has travelled twice from the neighbouring state of Maharashtra to appear for the exam in Rajasthan.  ""First time, they called off the exam. The second time, our answer sheets were abruptly snatched away midway as the question paper had leaked,"" she said. The problem is not unique to Rajasthan - exam leaks are notoriously common across India, where millions are unemployed and in search of secure jobs.  Political scientist Pankaj Kumar, who headed the Public Service Commission of Uttar Pradesh state that recruits civil servants, says ""it's the craze for a government position which makes people desperate"". Government jobs in India are generally for life and Mr Kumar says millions often wait for years to get one and ""spending money to cheat eventually becomes the motto of some aspirants"". In Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at least nine attempts to recruit schoolteachers and junior clerks have been cancelled since 2014 due to paper leaks. In the eastern state of West Bengal, authorities had to launch an investigation last year after question papers to hire teachers were widely shared on social media, hours before the exam.  The story is no different in the central state of Madhya Pradesh which was rocked by a massive recruitment scam in 2009 when aspirants taking a medical exam hired students from neighbouring states to write their papers. Question papers were also leaked and sold to candidates at astronomical prices, before authorities clamped down and arrested thousands. The heartland states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are equally infamous.  In Bihar, students are sometimes not allowed to wear shoes and socks to exam centres to stop them from cheating. In the past, authorities have imposed fines, jail terms and even detained parents for allegedly helping their children cheat.  In neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, exams are often conducted under CCTV surveillance.  Police say lapses usually occur when question papers are being transported to examination centres. In other instances, like in Udaipur, students go to great lengths to fake their identity, making it almost impossible for authorities to catch them.  There are no clear laws to deal with the problem at the moment, as most cases are recorded as bailable offences such as fraud and cheating. Some states like Uttarakhand have passed a law to punish offenders with life imprisonment, but critics say this has done little to improve the situation.  Ashok Rathore, a senior official investigating paper leaks in Rajasthan, says authorities need to come up with new ways of policing to tackle the problem.  ""We have asked the government to involve police and local administration even before the exam begins so that the question papers are beyond the reach of cheaters - just like ballot boxes are kept safe until the votes are counted,"" he said.  But experts say the problem also shines a spotlight on the unemployment crisis in India, where millions are unable to find jobs.  India's unemployment rate crept up to nearly 8% in December 2022, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think tank. It was less than 7% in 2021.  Almost 20 million people in India are employed by the federal and state governments, and officials estimate that at least a million more jobs are lying vacant at the moment.  ""Even 30 years after liberalisation, India doesn't have enough jobs for its population, which is nearing 1.4 billion,"" says writer and political commentator Gurcharan Das. He adds that government jobs are more lucrative in a country where three-quarters of its workforce is self employed with little to no social security benefits.  ""Unlike government jobs, private jobs do not come with a lifelong guarantee of security and pensions,"" Mr Das said. The job aspirants say their future looks bleak because of paper leaks and repeated cancellation of exams - they fear that they will soon be past the age limit to apply for these positions.  ""I attended years of coaching classes to qualify for a government job, but most of my exams got cancelled,"" said Devender Sharma.  The 30-year-old from the Bikaner city in Rajasthan has been applying for a decade for a low-skilled government job in the state.  ""My parents blame me for failing, even though it's the system which has let us down,"" he said.  Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The minimalist, unadorned picture, with no crown on the stamp or any other decoration, was approved personally by the King. ""The feedback we got back was that he wanted it to be simple,"" said Royal Mail director of external affairs, David Gold. ""It's a very human image, with no embellishment,"" he said. The design was also intended to provide continuity, influenced by the classic profile of Queen Elizabeth II created by the artist Arnold Machin in 1967. The new stamp is even more pared back and stark. It does not have any crown or royal symbols - unlike many of the predecessors, where kings' stamps often include an image of a crown and queens are depicted wearing a crown or diadem. ""It was 70 years that we had the same monarch and since 1967 we've had pretty much the same stamps,"" said Mr Gold. He said people would now have to get accustomed to seeing the new image on everyday first- and second-class stamps. Britain's postage stamps are unique in not showing the name of the country, and the new stamps have nothing except the King's head, the price and also, now, an attached barcode. The design is based on a sculpture made by artist Martin Jennings for the new King Charles coins - with the image then digitally adapted for stamps. Millions of new stamps are being printed, which will be used concurrently with those of Queen Elizabeth II, which will be sold until the old stocks run out. The image released by the Royal Mail is for so-called ""definitive"" stamps, which are the regular, plain, non-commemorative postage stamps. Some of the first sheets were unveiled at the Postal Museum in London, which is showing an exhibition called the King's Stamp. King Charles becomes the seventh monarch to appear on stamps - Queen Victoria was the first, in 1840, when her profile was shown on a ""Penny Black"". The picture of Queen Victoria used on the first stamps originated from an earlier sketch drawn when she was 15 years old, and that continued as the image used until her death at the age of 81.  King Charles has been an inveterate letter writer - figures from the Duchy of Cornwall suggest he personally wrote 1,830 letters in his final year as Prince of Wales, in response to more than 50,000 sent to him by the public. His letter writing when Prince of Wales also drew him into accusations of meddling in politics. During the Covid pandemic he wrote a personal letter praising the importance of postal workers as a ""point of daily human contact, a friendly, familiar face"", addressing his envelope to ""Everyone at Royal Mail"".

In total, 13 police officers could be disciplined for ""policy violations"", Jennifer Sink told Memphis City Council on Tuesday.  She declined to name the officers currently being investigated, saying the probe was not complete.  Mr Nichols, 29, died days after being beaten by members of the Memphis police force following a traffic stop.  His death has renewed nationwide calls for police reform, and his family will be attending President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on Tuesday night in Washington DC.  The president is expected to push for reforms in the televised speech.  To date, seven police officers have been relieved of duty in connection with the death of Mr Nichols, who was black, including six who were fired and one unnamed officer who was suspended.  Five of the officers fired - all of whom are also black - have been charged with his murder. Three emergency medical workers have also been fired for not providing Mr Nichols with adequate care.  In a written statement to the BBC on Tuesday, Ms Sink said that an administrative investigation is under way for the additional officers to ""determine if city policies were violated and what disciplinary action should be taken"".  The ""information is subject to change"", she said, and Memphis officials expect to share more information next week after hearings have been held. Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis told the city council that Memphis is ""still adding names to the list"" of officers charged in the incident.  She said around 10 police officers responded to the 7 January traffic stop. Video footage of the encounter released two weeks ago shows police using a taser, and pepper-spraying and hitting Mr Nichols.  The meeting, which focused on reforms in the wake of his death, was the first held since that footage was released to the public. One of the five police officers who was fired took a photograph of Mr Nichols and sent it to others, the New York Times reported on Tuesday, citing a police document.  Officer Demetrius Haley was seen in the video footage appearing to take a photo. He then sent it to at least five people, including two other officers, a civilian employee of the Memphis Police department, and a female acquaintance, the paper reported. Â© 2023 BBC.

Were there clues in his State of the Union speech about his re-election campaign? The State of the Union address is an opportunity for the president to lay out his legislative programme for the coming year. In Mr Biden's speech on Tuesday, he also sounded as though he was making the case for his 2024 run, and made it clear he has no plan to cool down his political ambitions, despite lukewarm polling. As he rattled off his list of achievements and laid out his plans for the future, we got a preview of what his campaign platform could be. Mr Biden had more to boast about in 2022 than many would have predicted, after his difficult first year in the White House. Some of the achievements he is claiming are economic: more jobs created in two years than any other president has created in four years; unemployment at the lowest rate in half a century. Although the bounce back from the pandemic lay-offs began under his predecessor, Donald Trump.  He spoke of legislative successes, too. In his speech, he touted passing a huge infrastructure bill, that will help rebuild crumbling roads and bridges across America, by forging cross-party support. Then there were his climate measures that will encourage the production of clean energy, and tax breaks that will encourage the production of semiconductor chips in America, to reduce reliance on China.  Add to that the much better-than expected-results for Democrats in last year's midterm elections and you can see why Mr Biden feels he is a good position to win a second term. Most importantly, he doesn't have any serious challengers for the nomination. No other senior Democrats would dare put their names forward as potential candidates if the president says he is running again.  And yet there are also serious weaknesses too.   A recent ABC-Washington Post poll that asked voters about a possible Biden vs Trump rematch gave Trump a 48% to 45% advantage. That's within the margin of error but still concerning for Democrats.  ""Two years is forever and it's just one poll, but if he's faring this poorly after a string of wins, that should be worrisome,"" tweeted Julian Castro, a former Obama cabinet member. Other surveys suggest the prospect of a Biden candidacy does not excite voters.  An AP-NORC poll suggests that 62% of Democrats don't want him to run again. Many said they think he is too old and would prefer a younger candidate.  A CBS poll published on Tuesday showed that well over half of voters asked, said Biden's policies were making inflation, gas prices and the overall economy worse.  Of course, it is almost ridiculously early to be looking at polls and trying to work out what voters will be thinking 21 months from now.  What Team Biden are relying on is that by 2024, voters will be feeling the benefit of some of the legislation that Biden has already passed.  They hope his infrastructure spending will not only have repaired the fabric of the nation but will create even more jobs. They hope manufacturing industries will be seeing increased investment. And that inflation may have been tamed.  When confronted about the poor polling figures, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Democrats won in the midterm elections because of Mr Biden's successes. As they look to mount a 2024 campaign, his team needs to prepare themselves on questions about his age as well as his record. This video can not be played Joe Biden gets heckled by Republicans The Republican rebuttal on Tuesday night by a 40-year-old rising star Sarah Huckabee Sanders highlighted the generational difference and called on a new wave of young, conservative politicians to seize the moment. As the oldest US president in history, how Joe Biden appeared in his primetime speech mattered almost as much as what he had to say.  Everyone knows he would be 86 by the end of a second term. Even voters who support him frequently express doubts about his advancing years. This was a much more energetic performance than last year's address.  On Tuesday he enjoyed taunting his Republican opponents. Fluent and confident, he succeeded in sounding like he still has a real passion to ""finish the job"" - a line he repeated often.  Within hours of finishing his speech, Mr Biden headed to the key electoral state of Wisconsin to promote his infrastructure plan.  It's a presidential visit that may look a lot like a campaign stop.

Government officials burned a plane and seized boats, weapons and petrol used by the miners in a remote region of the Amazon rainforest, which belongs to the Yanomami indigenous group.  Thousands of illegal gold miners have invaded the indigenous reserve on Brazil's border with Venezuela. The raid is part of a larger policy to halt the advance of illegal mining. It is a joint operation by Brazil's environmental protection agency, Ibama, the indigenous affairs department, Funai, and special forces tasked with protecting the environment.   With an estimated 20,000 illegal miners dispersed throughout the dense jungle region, officials said the aim of the raids was to interrupt the flow of supplies rather than to target individual settlements.  The miners and their illegal activities are a grave threat to the Yanomami indigenous group, which is estimated to have 28,000 members. Diseases, violence and environmental damages caused by the influx have triggered a humanitarian crisis among the Yanomami, resulting in the deaths from preventable diseases and hunger of scores of Yanomami children.  Two weeks ago. the government airlifted 16 members of the group out of the jungle to treat them for malnutrition.  Federal police last month launched an investigation to determine if the previous government of President Jair Bolsonaro could face charges of ""genocide"" after President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, who took office on 1 January, said that its treatment of the Yanomami was ""a premeditated crime"". Ex-President Bolsonaro actively encouraged economic development in the Amazon region. Violence there increased during his four years in power, with illegal miners opening fire on indigenous communities. Since the new government started taking action, some illegal miners have been seen leaving the Yanomami lands.  Marcio Astrini of the Climate Observatory, a network of 72 climate NGOs, said it was key to find alternative employment opportunities for the miners, many of whom are very poor.  He told the G1 news site: ""If nothing is done, if these people don't have alternative incomes. they will end up coming back to the areas from which they have been expelled, or they will invade mew ones."" Justice Minister FlÃ¡vio Dino said the federal government was working on a plan to support them.  Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

A doctor by training, the journalist and activist was banned from leaving Algeria pending an appeal trial but was not in detention. The holder of a French passport, she allegedly illegally went to Tunisia and then on to France with diplomatic help. Algeria has recalled its ambassador to Paris over the affair. The Algerian foreign ministry accused French diplomats and other personnel of participating ""in the illegal and secret evacuation of an Algerian national"". It said the incident was unacceptable and caused great damage to relations between Algeria and France, which had been warming recently after decades of animosity.  Bouraoui had been sentenced in 2021 to two years in jail for ""offending Islam"" and insulting the president, but was appealing against the ruling. She had spent 11 days in jail when the case was first in court. Earlier this week, she was arrested in Tunisia when she tried to take a flight and faced an extradition hearing where a judge freed her. Later she was able to board a plane to France, where is it reported she wanted to go to visit her son. Neither the French nor Tunisian governments have commented on the matter. Algeria gained independence from France in 1962 after a bloody seven-year war, which ended more than a century of a colonial rule. Relations had partly improved because France is looking for new suppliers of gas as European countries are boycotting Russia. Bouraoui was one of the key leaders of the anti-government Hirak movement, which led to long-time leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigning in 2019. Her father Mohamed Saleh Bouraoui was a well-known cardiologist and former high-ranking army officer, who once headed a military hospital in the capital, Algiers. After Mr Bouteflika's departure, protests continued against the military elite, which critics believe wields a lot of power in the North African nation. In the last few years, the Algerian authorities have further clamped down on freedom of expression, blocking websites and detaining journalists. The radio station on which Bouraoui used to host a weekly show, Radio M, was banned last year. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

She was wearing an electronic bracelet, and was meant to be under house arrest. ""My lawyer said 'flee, flee - they're going to put you in prison',"" she said at a press conference in Paris on Friday. She left Moscow at the start of one weekend last year, when she judged that police would be less active, and changed vehicle seven times before approaching the border on foot.   ""Our [last] vehicle got stuck in the mud,"" she told me, ""and we had no mobile phone coverage - we tried to find our way by the stars. It was a very dangerous and stressful escape."" They wandered for hours near the border, she said, hiding from border patrols, before successfully making it across. Part of that success is down to the organisation Reporters Sans FrontiÃ¨res (Reporters Without Borders). Its director, Christophe Deloire, explained how they helped her escape. ""I wrote my first text message to Marina the day after she went on TV with that sign,"" he told me. ""I sent her a message saying: Do you need help? We are here for you.""   Last September, Ms Ovsyannikova sent a message to the organisation through an intermediary, asking for their help to leave. ""We said, OK,"" explained Mr Deloire. ""[But] she's in Moscow under house arrest, her neighbours and family are Putinists - they could call the police and say she left - and she had an electronic bracelet. So there were many reasons [why] it was an incredibly difficult thing to escape. But she made it."" Now settled in Paris, Ms Ovsyannikova, 44, says she is still ""of course, afraid for her life"", but believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is risking his leadership over the war in Ukraine. ""The elite understands everything perfectly,"" she explained. ""The people are living in this bubble of propaganda, but the ruling elite - those who have lost their planes, their yachts, their finances - they understand everything. As soon as a Ukrainian victory gets closer, I believe, the ruling establishment will present Putin with a big bill."" Ms Ovsyannikova grabbed headlines around the world last March, when she burst into a live news broadcast at the state-run Channel One TV station where she worked at the time, with a sign reading ""no war, stop the war; don't believe the propaganda; they're lying to you here"". She said she was ""immediately isolated by the FSB [Russia's security service]"", and her bosses interrogated. As she collected her belongings from the office, she told me that ""I saw in my co-workers' eyes a totally compassionate expression.  ""They were looking at me with wild eyes, they were saying goodbye. They thought they would never see me again."" Ms Ovsyannikova left Russia for Germany soon afterwards, but returned later that year - to fight for custody of her children, she says. Further protests, including a demonstration near the Kremlin in July, saw her facing charges under a new Russian law, banning ""deliberately false information"" about Russia's armed forces.   The law made it illegal to call the war an ""invasion,"" with Russian state-controlled news organisations instead told to describe it as a ""special military operation"". Despite being targeted by the Russian regime, many Ukrainian journalists and Russian dissidents have expressed mistrust of Ms Ovsyannikova, pointing to her earlier career as a mouthpiece for the Russian state. Her visit to Ukraine last summer to cover the war for Germany's Die Welt newspaper outraged many Ukrainians, who demanded her immediate sacking. Â© 2023 BBC.

But the 90-year-old says that it was not his intention when he started work on the project in the 1980s. ""It's all a mistake really. It was only meant to be temporary,"" said Stuart. ""When I started doing it up I was just getting such a buzz doing it. ""I got carried away and I ended up with this."" His little house is located in the woods in Glen Affric, in the Highlands. The great-grandfather bought the plot of land - which contained a derelict house and a dilapidated livestock shed, known as a byre - back in 1984. The properties had originally belonged to a shoemaker. Over the years, previous residents of the byre had included a cow, a donkey and a pig. Stuart, a skilled joiner, had intended to renovate the house and make it his home in the Highlands after two stints living and working in Australia, which amounted to a total of 14 years. But before starting work on the house, he decided to convert the byre into temporary accommodation. That stop-gap then become a labour of love. When he began, there were no doors. All that remained of the byre was its four walls and two entrances. He connected the property to mains electricity, but at the start his only household electrical appliance was a 100W bulb. Over the years Stuart has turned it into a cosy little home, largely using wood in its construction and furnishing it with items including a stove rescued from a scrapheap. He has also installed stained glass windows and carved owl heads into each step of a staircase.  Stuart has many years' experience working with wood. His first job was as a woodcutter, back when Clydesdale horses were still used to haul timber out of Highland forests. He then served an apprenticeship as a joiner before working in sawmills in Scotland and Australia. The property's oval door and overall aesthetic has led to it being nicknamed the Hobbit house by neighbours and visitors. But Stuart told BBC Radio Scotland's Out of Doors programme this was ""just a coincidence"". He has not read JRR Tolkien's books The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, or seen any of the film or TV adaptations of the author's work. For Stuart, it is simply called home - and he believes it is nothing special. He is still working to convert the main house, but jokes that he will be 130 by the time that project is completed. Stuart is still working away on his projects, though concedes old age has slowed down the progress. And even after all his hard work to make the byre into a house, it still seems to be an attraction to livestock. Stuart added: ""The sheep in the neighbouring field sometimes get in here and I get woken by sheep jumping on my roof."" Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Should governments tax them more?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64583982,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1371B/production/_125334697_gettyimages-1349637091.jpg,2023-02-12T01:42:56Z,"The big oil companies - from the UK-based BP and Shell to international giants such as ExxonMobil and Norwayâs Equinor - have been announcing astonishing profit figures. They are all benefitting from the surging price of oil and gas following the invasion of Ukraine.  While they rake in the profits, people around the world are struggling to pay their energy bills and fill up their cars - leading to calls for higher taxes on these companies. So how are they making so much money, and should the government step in to stop them? Oil and gas are traded around the world, and if supplies are short and demand high, sellers can charge more, and the price goes up. Before the Ukraine war, Russia was the worldâs largest exporter of oil and natural gas.   A lot of the money that people paid to buy that oil and gas went to the Russian government - those exports made up 45% of the Russian government budget in 2021.  After the invasion, Western countries, including the UK and EU, tried to stop (or at least massively reduce) their energy imports from Russia, to avoid funding the Russian military and supporting a hostile regime. Countries that didnât want to buy from Russia had to pay much higher prices for oil produced elsewhere.  Oil prices had already been rising as economies reopened following Covid-19 lockdowns, and people needed more oil.  The day after the Russian invasion, the oil price went above $100 a barrel, and peaked at over $127 in March, before coming back down to around $85. Gas prices also soared after the invasion.  Oil and natural gas are crucial to almost every aspect of modern life. Oil is used to make petrol and diesel, and natural gas is used for heating and cooking. They're also used in agriculture, electricity generation, and other industrial processes which make everything from fertilizer to plastics.  So a sustained rise in oil and gas prices pushes up the cost of many other things we buy, driving the cost of living crisis that has gripped the UK - and other countries - in recent months. Oil companies make money by locating oil and gas reserves buried in rocks under the earth's surface, and drilling down to release them.  The costs donât vary that much as the price goes up or down, but the money they make from selling it does.  So when oil prices soared after the invasion of Ukraine, the money these companies made from selling oil and gas massively increased as well. On Tuesday, BP reported record annual profits of $27.7bn (Â£23bn) for 2022, as it scaled back plans to reduce the amount of oil and gas it produces by 2030. Those profits were double the previous year's figure. In February, Shell reported its highest profits in 115 years. Profits hit $39.9bn (Â£32.2bn) in 2022, double the previous year's total. The profits they make donât all disappear - lots of ordinary people own shares in BP, Shell, and other global oil companies. This may be via their pension funds, and they may not even be aware of it. Some of the extra profits are paid to shareholders through higher dividends, and buying back shares (which increases the share price). But as long as the billions roll in while customers struggle to pay their bills, the calls for higher taxes will continue.  Big oil companies made their record profits even after paying billions to governments around the world. BP and Shell are in a complicated position because they are headquartered in the UK but produce a relatively small amount of oil and gas in UK waters. They make most of their profits from activities around the world. Shell paid $134m (Â£110m) tax on its UK operations in 2022, out of a worldwide tax bill of $13bn.  BP paid $2.2bn (Â£1.8bn) in taxes on its UK operations, out of a global tax bill of $15bn. Oil companies already pay a tax on their profits from oil and gas production in the UK of 40% - which is higher than taxes on other companies.  But they can reduce that tax bill by deducting the cost of shutting down old oil rigs, or offsetting future investments and losses from earlier years.  In some years, BP and Shell have paid no tax on UK operations, and received payments from the UK government instead. After the invasion of Ukraine, the government faced calls to introduce an extra ""windfall tax"" on energy company profits to help pay for soaring energy bills.  This was introduced in May 2022, and increased from 25% to 35% in November. It is now expected to raise around Â£40bn extra from all the companies operating in UK waters between 2022 and 2028. However, the windfall tax only applies to the profits on UK oil and gas production, which only account for a small share of some firms' profits.  And firms can deduct more than 90% of the cost of new exploration and production from their windfall tax bills, significantly reducing what they have to pay.  The windfall tax accounted for all of Shell's UK tax bill, and $700m (Â£538m) of BP's. Politicians, environmentalists, trade unions and poverty campaigners have attacked oil companiesâ record profits, and argued for higher windfall taxes. They say high prices are the result of something beyond the oil firm's control - war, and that it's not fair that oil companies are profiting from people's suffering. Some say higher windfall taxes are a good way for governments to raise money because they're easy to collect and hard to avoid. Even the former boss of Shell himself, Ben van Beurden, wondered if it was inevitable that governments would need to tax energy producers more to protect the poorest in society. But oil firms argue that a higher windfall tax would make them less willing to invest in producing in the UK, and that they would search for oil elsewhere where taxes are lower.  Harbour Energy, which produces more oil and gas in the UK than anyone else, is cutting jobs and reconsidering its UK investments because of the windfall tax. If the UK government decided to tax BP and Shell on their global profits more heavily, they could potentially move their headquarters out of the country - escaping the new tax, and depriving the UK of much of the revenues they currently pay. Oil companies have to operate in a world where the price of oil can go down as well as up, with little warning. Money made in the good years helps to balance out years when oil prices are low. Many oil companies lost billions from Russian investments last year - BP wrote off $24bn of investments in the Russian oil company Rosneft, for example.  They also have to invest billions to find new reserves of oil to keep supplies running until the world switches over to renewable sources of power. Energy companies have a big role to play in that switch-over, too. BP and Shell invest some of the billions they make from oil and gas into renewable power such as solar and wind farms, and charging stations for electric cars. BP boss Bernard Looney said the British company was ""helping provide the energy the world needs"" while investing the transition to green energy. Shell chief executive Wael Sawan said that these are ""incredibly difficult times - we are seeing inflation rampant around the world"" but that Shell was playing its part by investing in renewable technologies. Its chief financial officer Sinead Gorman added that Shell had paid $13bn in taxes globally in 2022.  However, BP scaled back its plans to cut its carbon emissions this year because demand for oil and gas is so strong. The energy price cap was introduced in 2019 to stop companies overcharging people who didn't shop around for cheaper deals. It targets energy suppliers, and doesn't affect the profits of oil and gas producers. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Irem! Merve! Irem,"" rescue worker Mustafa Ozturk is shouting. Everyone around us has been ordered to be silent. The team are looking for two sisters who other survivors say are trapped alive under piles of rubble. With sensitive devices they listen for any response. Everyone is frozen in anticipation. And then, a breakthrough. ""Irem, my dear, I am close to you, you hear me, yes?"" Mustafa says.  Those of us watching can't hear it, but it is clear now that she is responding. A small group of the girls' friends wait silently with us. ""You are superb! Now you stay calm and answer me. Ah ok, that's Merve. Merve dear, just answer my questions,"" he says. Merve, 24, and her sister Irem, 19, were trapped under the rubble of their five-storey apartment block in Antakya, southern Turkey, which was flattened by the earthquake. It had been two days, but for them those days felt like weeks. ""It's Wednesday. No! You weren't trapped for 14 days. Give us five minutes. You will be out."" Mustafa knows it will take hours, but tells us: ""If they lose their hope they might not survive."" Merve and Irem start to joke and laugh together. I can see a big smile on Mustafa's face: ""If they had space they would probably dance,"" he says. By the rescuers' calculations it is 2m (6.6 ft) to reach the sisters but Hasan Binay, the rescue team's commander, says digging a tunnel into the concrete is a very delicate operation. One wrong move could lead to a catastrophe. A bulldozer is called to very slightly lift and hold the thick concrete to stop the building collapsing when they start digging. ""Girls, soon we will give you blankets."" Mustafa tells the sisters. ""Ah no, you don't worry about us. We are not tired or cold."" Mustafa says Merve is worried about the rescuers' situation. It is 20:30 local time and it is very cold. This area has had one of the coldest winters that people can remember. The rescuers start furiously digging and throwing the rubble away with their bare hands. But after a couple of hours we feel the ground suddenly shaking under our feet. It is a strong aftershock. Operations must stop and we leave the devastated building. ""There is a brutal reality here. The safety of our team comes first,"" Hasan says. After 30 minutes, Mustafa and three other rescuers go back to where they were digging. ""Don't be scared. Believe me we won't leave you here. I will bring you out and you will take us for a good lunch,"" Mustafa shouts. The girls thought they had been left to die. It is midnight now and the digging has resumed. The team have hardly slept for days. We have gathered around a small fire next to the building. Every so often there is a shout: ""sessizlik"", meaning silence. The light goes off, total darkness now. They have made a small hole in the concrete to see if the girls can see the light coming from Mustafa's torch. ""Merve! Irem! Do you see the light? OK! Perfect! Now I am sending a small camera down. Once you see it tell me and I will tell you what to do."" It is a moment of elation for everyone. Hasan joins his team to see the girls on the small screen connected to their night vision camera. They can see both Irem and Merve. ""You are so beautiful. Don't move too much. Irem pull the camera so we can see Merve better.""  On the screen, we see that Irem is smiling. Luckily there is enough space for them between the concrete trapping them. Relief floods everyone's faces. The girls look well and at least Irem has room to pull herself out if they make the hole bigger. But almost immediately the team look concerned. Merve has told them that she has started to feel cold and there is something heavy on her feet. The medics were worried: ""Do Merve's feet have gangrene? Or is this the first symptom of hypothermia?"" It is around 05:00 now. The tunnel is big enough for the slimmest team member to crawl down. The rescuer was able to reach and hold Irem's hand for a few moments. ""Our mother's body has started to stink and we can't breathe properly,"" Irem tells the rescuers. The girls have been lying next to their dead mother for days. It is shocking. How awful that there can be moments in life when you would not want your mother next to you, we reflected. Hasan asks one of Merve's friends - still waiting, stressed and silent - to show them the picture she has of the girls. They are trying to estimate the width they need to make the hole. The two girls are smiling, in party dresses, celebrating a wedding. ""Perfect! We can bring them out."" The medical team gets ready with thermal blankets and stretchers. Everyone is excited. It is 06:30 and Irem comes first. She is laughing and crying at the same time. ""God bless you. Please bring Merve out too. Please,"" she begs the rescuers. ""Merve will follow. I promise,"" Hasan tells her. But bringing Merve out takes another tense 30 minutes. They need to free her feet from under the concrete without doing her harm. The operation is successful. Once Merve is out, everyone starts clapping and cheering. I hear Merve screaming in pain but then asking: ""Am I really alive?"" ""You are dear,"" Mustafa replies, smiling. The friends who have been here all night start shouting in tears. ""Merve! Irem! We are here. Don't be scared."" The sisters were loaded into ambulances and transferred to a field hospital. After this joyful moment comes a chilling one. The rescuers ask everyone to be silent again. This is the last call. ""If anyone hears me, respond. If you can't respond, try to touch the ground."" Hasan repeats, imploringly, from different angles. Then sadly, with red spray he signs on the concrete, writing codes so other rescue teams will not search the building. ""Rescuing a human being is a beautiful feeling, but we wish there were no deaths."" I can see the sadness in his face. ""Will you eat lunch with Merve and Irem?"" I ask. He smiles: ""I hope one day we can. But the most important thing is that they are alive and in good hands now."" Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Gabrielle buffeted Australia's Norfolk Island overnight and has begun to lash the northernmost region of New Zealand. Forecasters have issued ""red"" heavy wind and rain warnings for Auckland and Northland with 200mm of rain and winds of up to 130kph (80mph) expected. Evacuation centres have been set up and residents have been preparing. They have been told to ensure they have enough supplies to last three days in case they are trapped at home. The storm - which has been downgraded from a cyclone - comes weeks after torrential rain inundated the city of Auckland., which remains under a state of emergency. Tens of thousands of sandbags have been distributed there due to concerns the sodden ground and weakened infrastructure have made homes more vulnerable to flooding.  Air New Zealand, the national carrier, has cancelled several domestic flights ahead of the storm's arrival.  On Norfolk Island, which covers just over 34 sq km (13 sq miles) in the Pacific Ocean between New Caledonia and New Zealand, authorities said they were clearing debris and trees from roads and restoring power knocked out in the storm. ""There is still considerable clean up to be undertaken and it may take a while for services such as power to be restored,"" Emergency Management Norfolk Island said. New Zealand's MetService has warned winds could still be strong enough to damage trees and power lines and that enough rain could fall to cause further flooding and landslides in the coming days.  Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said: ""Our main message to people across the country is to please take the severe weather warning seriously and to make sure you're prepared. ""Make sure you've got your grab-and-go kits, make sure you know where you need to go in the event you need to evacuate your homes."" The Coromandel Peninsula and the TairÄwhiti/Gisborne region, which were also affected by the recent torrential rain, have been placed under the most serious weather alert. Residents in flood-prone areas have been told to prepare to evacuate. ""There's a degree of nervousness and anxiety around this coming event,"" the Thames-Coromandel district's mayor, Len Salt, told the Stuff news website.

Those living here on the Syrian side may have been displaced by the country's more than decade-old civil war. But they could also be survivors of the earthquake. Catastrophes overlap in Syria.  The earthquake, untroubled by international borders, has brought havoc to both countries. But the international relief effort has been thwarted by checkpoints. In southern Turkey, thousands of rescue workers with heavy lifting gear, paramedics and sniffer dogs have jammed the streets, and are still working to find survivors. In this part of opposition-held north-west Syria, none of this is going on.  I had just crossed the border from four days in the city of Antakya, Turkey, where the aid response is a cacophony - ambulance sirens blare all night long, dozens of earth movers roar and rip apart concrete 24 hours a day. Among the olive groves in the village of Bsania, in Syria's Idlib province, there's mostly silence. The homes in this border area were newly built. Now more than 100 have gone, turned to aggregate and a ghostly white dust which gusts across the farmland. As I climb over the chalky remains of the village, I spot a gap in the ruin. Inside, a pink-tiled bathroom sits perfectly preserved.  The earthquake swallowed Abu Ala's home, and claimed the lives of two of his children.  ""The bedroom is there, that's my house,"" he says, pointing to pile of rubble. ""My wife, daughter and I were sleeping here - Wala', the 15-year-old girl, was at the edge of the room towards the balcony. A bulldozer was able to find her, [so] I took her and buried her.""  In the dark, he and his wife clung to olive trees as aftershocks rocked the hillside.  The Syrian Civil Defence Force - also known as the White Helmets - which operates in opposition-held areas, did what they could with pickaxes and crowbars. The rescuers, who receive funding from the British government, lack modern rescue equipment. Abu Ala' breaks down when he describes the search for his missing 13-year-old son, Ala'. ""We kept digging until evening the next day. May God give strength to those men. They went through hell to dig my boy up.""  He buried the boy next to his sister.  Bsania wasn't much, but it was home. Rows of modern apartment buildings, with balconies facing out across the Syrian countryside into Turkey. Abu Ala' describes it as a thriving community. ""We had nice neighbours, nice people. [They] are dead now."" A deeply religious man, he is now bereft. ""What am I going to do?"" he asks. ""There are no tents, no aid, nothing. We've received nothing but God's mercy until now. And I'm here left to roam the streets.""  As we leave, he asks me if I have a tent. But we have nothing to give him.  I meet up with the White Helmets, expecting to find them looking for survivors. But it is too late. Ismail al Abdullah, is weary from effort, and what he describes as the world's disregard for the Syrian people. He says the international community has blood on its hands.  ""We stopped looking for survivors after more than 120 hours passed,"" he says. ""We tried our best to save our people, but we couldn't. No-one listened to us.  ""From the first hour we called for urgent action, for urgent help. No-one responded. They were just saying, 'We are with you', nothing else. We said, we need equipment. No-one responded.""  Apart from a few Spanish doctors, no international aid teams have reached this part of Syria. It is an enclave of resistance from Bashar al-Assad's rule. Under Turkish protection, it is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamist group that was once affiliated to al-Qaeda. The group has cut those links, but almost all governments have no relations with them. For our entire time in Syria, armed men, who didn't want to be filmed, accompanied us and stood at a distance.  More than a decade into Syria's stalled civil war, the 1.7m people who live in this area continue to oppose President Assad's rule. They live in makeshift camps and newly built shelters. Most have been displaced more than once, so life here was already very hard before the earthquake.  The international help that reaches this part of Syria is tiny. Many of the earthquake victims were taken to the Bab al-Hawa hospital, which is supported by the Syrian American Medical Society. They treated 350 patients in the immediate aftermath, general surgeon Dr Farouk al Omar tells me, all with only one ultrasound.  When I ask him about international aid, he shakes his head, and laughs. ""We cannot talk more about this topic. We spoke about that a lot. And nothing happened. Even in a normal situation, we don't have enough medical staff. And just imagine what it's like in this catastrophe after earthquake,"" he says.  At the end of the corridor, a tiny baby lies in an incubator. Mohammad Ghayyath Rajab's skull is bruised and bandaged, and his small chest rises and falls thanks to a respirator. Doctors can't be sure, but they think he's around three months old. Both of his parents were killed in the earthquake, and a neighbour found him crying alone in the dark in the rubble of his home.  The Syrian people have been forsaken many times, and tell me they have grown used to being disregarded. But still there is anger that more help is not forthcoming.  In the town of Harem, Fadel Ghadab lost his aunt and cousin.  ""How is it possible that the UN has sent a mere 14 trucks worth of aid?"" he asks. ""We've received nothing here. People are in the streets.""  More aid has made it into Syria, but not much and it is too little, too late.  In the absence of international rescue teams in Harem, children remove rubble. A man and two boys use a car-jack to prize apart the collapsed remains of a building, carefully salvaging animal feed onto a blanket. Life isn't cheaper in Syria, but it is more precarious. The day is ending and I have to leave. I cross the border back into Turkey and soon get stuck in a traffic jam or ambulances, construction equipment - the gridlock of a national and international aid response.  My phone pings with a message from a Turkish rescuer telling me his team found a woman alive after 132 hours buried under her home. Behind me in Syria, as darkness falls, there is only silence.

""It's going to make a big difference. We are now using just one crossing,"" a UN spokesman told the BBC. But the White Helmets rescue group criticised the UN for waiting for President Bashar al-Assad's permission. Many Syrians have been angry over the lack of aid for their war-torn nation. Countries with friendly relations with Mr Assad, including Russia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, began flying supplies to government-controlled areas of Syria soon after the earthquakes struck nieghbouring southern Turkey eight days ago. But the opposition-held north-west - where some 4.1 million people were relying on humanitarian assistance to survive even before the disaster - received no aid deliveries from the UN via Turkey until Thursday. The UN blamed damage to roads leading to the Bab al-Hawa crossing, which is the only land route the UN Security Council has authorised it to use.  As of Monday, 58 aid lorries had crossed into the opposition enclave, carrying food, tents and medicines. However, they did not include the heavy machinery and other specialist equipment requested by the White Helmets, whose first responders are leading the rescue effort there.  The use of any other crossings with Turkey has been vetoed by Russia, a key ally of Mr Assad, and China since 2020. Until now, they have insisted that all other UN deliveries must go via Damascus and cross the front-lines, even though just 10 such convoys were approved during the whole of last year. The UN made the announcement about using the Bab al-Salameh and al-Rai border crossings - which are both controlled by Turkish-backed Syrian rebels - after high-level talks with President Assad in Damascus on Monday. It said the crossings would initially be open for three months. ""Very shortly we will use the other two crossings,"" UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres' spokesman StÃ©phane Dujarric told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme. ""We hope that the agreement will last as long as we need to use it. We will start using it as quickly as possible and I don't want to make any assumptions, the only thing I want to assume is that people will put politics aside wherever they stand in this conflict."" He did not give any further details on when the two crossings would open and defended the delay in waiting for the government's permission. ""It is our understanding that other aid organisations not affiliated with the UN have been using these border crossings. We have to operate within certain perimeters, that's the nature of the United Nations."" Mr Assad did not comment on the announcement. But when asked by a reporter why it had taken a week, his envoy to the UN, Bassam al-Sabbagh, replied: ""Why are you asking me?... We are not the one controlling these borders."" The head of the White Helmets accused Mr Assad of a ""cynical move that has come far too late"" and criticised the UN's decision to seek his approval. ""The UN's insistence on waiting for the Syrian regime's permission - the very regime that has bombed, gassed, starved, forcibly displaced and imprisoned millions of Syrians - is unforgivable,"" he wrote in an opinion piece for CNN. ""It is no secret that the Syrian regime is not a credible partner in addressing the suffering of all Syrians in a neutral and impartial manner."" Mr Saleh separately told Reuters news agency that the search operation for survivors underneath the rubble of collapsed buildings in the north-west was about to come to a close. ""The indications we have are that there are not any [survivors], but we are trying to do our final checks and on all sites,"" he said. The White Helmets have so far reported 2,274 deaths and 12,400 injuries across the north-west. Satellite photographs released by Maxar on Monday showed the devastation in Jindayris, a town close to the Turkish border where they say more than 200 buildings have been completely destroyed. The White Helmets have recovered at least 517 bodies in Jindayris and described the situation there as ""catastrophic"". The government has reported 1,414 deaths and 2,349 injuries across its territory. Aleppo province was badly affected, with more than 200,000 people left homeless, according to the UN.  Â© 2023 BBC.

Lamar Johnson, 50, walked out of the St Louis' courtroom a free man after a ruling by Judge David Mason on Tuesday. The judge said he acted after two witnesses had provided ""clear and convincing evidence"" that Mr Johnson was innocent.  He had been convicted of murdering Marcus Boyd in 1994. Mr Johnson was visibly moved when the ruling was announced, while his supporters started cheering and applauding. ""This is overwhelming,"" said Mr Johnson, after leaving the courtroom. Last year, Attorney Kim Gardner had filed a motion seeking the release of Mr Johnson after conducting an investigation together with the Innocence Project non-profit legal organisation.  Following Tuesday's hearing, Mr Johnson's legal team criticised the office of the state attorney general which had pushed to keep him in prison.  The office ""never stopped claiming Lamar was guilty and was comfortable to have him languish and die in prison,"" Mr Johnson's attorneys said in a statement.  A spokesperson for the attorney general said in an email that the office will take no further action in the case.  ""Our office defended the rule of law and worked to uphold the original verdict that a jury of Johnson's peers deemed to be appropriate based on the facts presented at trial,"" the statement said. Marcus Boyd was shot dead by two masked men on Mr Johnson's front porch in October 1994. Mr Johnson has repeatedly said that he was not at home when the attack happened. Judge Mason issued his ruling after one witness had recanted his testimony, and an inmate had confessed that he shot Boyd with another suspect, Phil Campbell. During the initial trial, Campbell pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and was sentenced to seven years in prison.

They gathered on Wednesday for a second time in Wuhan, where Covid was first detected, and also in the north-eastern city of Dalian. The second round of protests in seven days puts pressure on President Xi Jinping's administration just weeks before the annual National People's Congress, which will usher in a new leadership team. Protests first took place in Wuhan on 8 February after provincial authorities said they were cutting the level of medical expenses which retirees can claim back from the government.  Social media footage shows the protesters to be largely elderly retirees, who say this comes at a time of soaring healthcare costs.  Although such health insurance matters are handled at a provincial level, protests have spread to different parts of the country in what appears to be a renewed belief in the power of demonstrating in China. At the end of last year, thousands of young Chinese took part in protests that eventually forced the government to overturn its strict zero-Covid measures - people had grown weary of the mass testing and sudden, sweeping lockdowns that had been smashing the economy.  But the abrupt change in policy placed China's medical system under enormous strain, as the coronavirus quickly spread through the country. It led to an unknown number of deaths and reporting by the BBC appeared to show that a vast majority of those who died were elderly.  The changes to health benefits for retirees, which officials have described as reforms, come just as China emerges from that brutal Covid wave.  The plan has been sold as a means of trading off reimbursement levels to increase the scope of coverage to include more areas. However criticism of plan on social media has included the widely held view that Chinese officials are trying to recoup the vast amounts of money spent on compulsory Covid testing and other pandemic measures. Officials in both Wuhan and Dalian said they had no knowledge of the most recent protests and, as such, had no comment to make. Calls to local police stations went unanswered. Radio Free Asia reported that retired iron and steel workers made up a significant proportion of the original protest group in Wuhan.  The use of existing social network links could help to explain how these gatherings have been coordinated in a country where organising dissent against the government in any form is difficult and can lead to severe punishment, including prison sentences. Video clips shared on social media showed elderly protestors singing the global Communist anthem, the Internationale. In the past, this song has been used as a means of indicating that demonstrators are not against the government or the Communist Party but merely want their grievances resolved. A shopkeeper who witnessed this Wednesday's protest in Wuhan told the BBC that police on both sides of a nearby road had blocked access to the area in order to prevent more people joining the hundreds of elderly demonstrators who were already chanting slogans. Three years of the pandemic crisis followed by a tumultuous exit from zero-Covid have generated considerable public discontent over China's health policies.  Mr Xi had given the country's Covid amelioration policies his personal stamp of approval and the Party has struggled to explain why such a sudden about-face was necessary. The Chinese government had also publicly ridiculed other countries for opening up too early, claiming they had unnecessarily sacrificed their people as a result. It then turned around and abandoned its own restrictions at an even greater speed than other nations had done, and did so after maintaining lockdowns and other harsh measures for much longer than anywhere else in the world. Many here now believe that, as a result, livelihoods were unnecessarily destroyed. On China's Twitter-like Weibo social media platform, the hashtag #healthinsurance - in Chinese - has attracted millions of hits but was removed from the site's ""hot topics"" section. The hashtag matching the site of the most recent protests in Wuhan - Zhongshan Park - was censored and photos claiming to be of the demonstration have been removed.  However, even with China's vast censorship apparatus swinging into action, a large amount of support is still being expressed for the protesting retirees on social media. Beijing will need to find a way to resolve the issue if it wants to avoid further public agitation. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Frustration has been building for weeks after a shortage of the newly designed naira notes led to a lack of cash. Some customers in southern Nigeria's Warri and Benin City reportedly set fire to two commercial banks. Nigerians have faced long queues at cash machines with some sleeping outside banks to try and be first in line to get some money. People say they have been forced to skip meals and work without cash to pay for food or transport to their jobs. Some banks were broken into while protesters looted their cash machines. In Benin City, customers attempted to invade the Central Bank of Nigeria's (CBN) local offices but security officers fired tear gas at them. The CBN said it redesigned the higher denomination notes - 200, 500 and 1,000 naira - to replace the dirty cash in circulation, tackle inflation, curb counterfeiting and promote a cashless society.  Nigerians were told last October about the change and were encouraged to deposit any cash savings in the bank. But not enough of the new notes have been released in a country where cash is still widely used. An estimated 40% of the population do not have access to bank accounts. Protesters in Ibadan blocked roads while crowds have attacked Central Bank offices and other commercial banks in anger at not being able to withdraw their savings. Footage gathered by BBC Yoruba and circulating over social media shows protesters expressing their frustrations. It comes just 10 days before elections in the country - President Muhammadu Buhari is facing calls to take action to avoid losing votes for the ruling All Progressives Congress. The bank had issued a 10 February deadline for the old notes to cease being legal tender, but the Supreme Court stopped it as a result of a legal challenge from 10 states. The case was due to resume on Wednesday but has been delayed until next week, just three days before the elections. Additional reporting by Megan Fisher Â© 2023 BBC.

68,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,The race across Europe to build green steel plants,A project is underway in northern Sweden which will drastically cut CO2 emissions in making steel.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64538296,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16155/production/_128635409_gettyimages-1352461547.jpg,2023-02-17T00:03:43Z,"A small military town in Sweden's frozen north is on course to produce Europe's first commercial green steel. Giant diggers and excavators are powering through layers of mud, ice and snow at the site of a new steel plant just outside Boden, 900 km (559 miles) north of Stockholm. At 09:00, the sun has only just risen and the temperature is -8C. Some of the workers are wearing three or four jackets, and have switched on the heated seats in their vehicles. Steel is usually made in a process that starts with blast furnaces. Fed with coking coal and iron ore, they emit large quantities of carbon dioxide and contribute to global warming. The production of steel is responsible for around 7% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. But in Boden, the new plant will use hydrogen technology, designed to cut emissions by as much as 95%. Although the first buildings have yet to go up on the remote site, the company behind the project, H2 Green Steel, believes it's on course to roll out the first commercial batches of its steel by 2025. If it succeeds, it will be the first large-scale green steel plant in Europe, with its products used in the same way as traditional steel, to construct everything from cars and cargo ships to buildings and bridges. Although much of Europe's steelmaking industry dates back centuries, H2 Green Steel is a start-up that didn't even exist before the pandemic. When Northvolt opened Sweden's first giant electric battery factory two hours south of Boden, it wanted to find a greener way of producing the steel needed to make the batteries, and H2 Green Steel emerged as a spin-off with funding from two of Northvolt's founders. Audio: The remote Swedish town leading in green steel The centrepiece of the new steel plant will be a tall structure called a DRI tower (DRI means a direct reduction of iron). Inside this, hydrogen will react with iron ore to create a type of iron that can be used to make steel. Unlike coking coal, which results in carbon emissions, the by-product of the reaction in the DRI tower is water vapour. All the hydrogen used at the new green steel plant will be made by H2Green Steel.  Water from a nearby river is passed through an electrolyser - a process which splits off the hydrogen from water molecules.  The electricity used to make the hydrogen and power the plant comes from local fossil-free energy sources, including hydropower from the nearby Lule river, as well as wind parks in the region. ""This a unique spot to start with. You have to have the space, and you have to have the green electricity,"" says Ida-Linn NÃ¤zelius, vice president of environment and society at H2 Green Steel. H2Green Steel has already signed a deal with Spanish energy company Iberdrola to build a green steel plant powered by solar energy in the Iberian peninsula, and says it's exploring other opportunities in Brazil. On home soil it's got friendly competition from another Swedish steel company, Hybrit, which is planning to open a similar fossil-free steel plant in northern Sweden by 2026. This firm is a joint venture for Nordic steel company SSAB, mining firm LKAB and energy company Vattenfall, boosted by state funding from the Swedish Energy Agency and the EU's Innovation fund. While Sweden is leading the way when it comes to carbon-cutting steel production in Europe, it is important to put its potential impact in context, says Katinka Lund Waagsaether, a senior policy advisor at the Brussels-based climate think tank E3G.  H2 Green Steel hopes to produce five million tonnes of green steel a year by 2030. Global annual production is currently around 2,000 million tonnes, according to figures from the World Steel Association. ""The production capacity in Sweden will be a drop in the sea,"" says Ms Lund Waagsaether. But other ventures should help increase the proportion of green steel available in Europe. These include, GravitHy, which plans to open a hydrogen-based plant in France, in 2027. German steel giant Thyssenkrupp recently announced it aims to introduce carbon-neutral production at all its plants by 2045. Europe's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal and the Spanish government are also investing in green steel projects in northern Spain. Meanwhile, the EU is in the process of finalising a new strategy called the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, designed to make it more expensive for European companies to import cheaper, non-green steel from other parts of the world. ""I think it is important in that it'll give industry the confidence to invest, because they can see that, at least in the European context, their steel will be competitive,"" says Ms Lund Waagsaether.  More technology of business: She also points to a ""a crucial window of action"" between now and 2030, with around 70% of steelworks around the world in need of repair and reinvestment during this period. Blast furnaces could be replaced or relined to extend their lifetimes, but a smarter long-term strategy, argues Ms Lund Waagsaether, would be to invest in switching to carbon-cutting production processes instead. ""The next eight years are crucial for making sure that companies and investors globally make decisions towards green steel production... which is going to 'lock us in' for another few decades."" But whether the majority of big steel producers will follow this path is difficult to predict, says Lundberg. ""I would say I'm hopeful, but we need to keep the pressure up."" In the UK, the government is reported to be ready to stump up Â£600m to help Britain's two largest steelmakers switch away from coal-fired blast furnaces. However the country remains ""very much a laggard"" in green steel circles, according to Chris McDonald, chief executive of the UK's national innovation centre for steel and metals, the Materials Processing Institute. ""A big reason for that is that currently the UK has very high energy prices compared with other countries, and that means it makes the steel industry unsustainable and it makes investment less attractive in the UK."" Another challenge, says Mr McDonald, is figuring out how to negate high unemployment in industrial heartlands if existing steel plants shut down, or require different skill sets from employees once they've been remodelled. ""It's more complicated, I think, than just opening up the market and allowing new entrants to come in, because we're trying to manage a green transition and to manage the social consequences at the same time,"" he argues.  In Boden, the arrival of H2 Green Steel is being viewed as a major opportunity for job creation in an area that's been crying out for new industries for decades. The small military town shrunk after army budget cuts and closure of a large hospital in the region in the 1990s, resulting in thousands of people moving elsewhere to find work.  ""This is our biggest opportunity in more than 100 years,"" says the town's Social Democrat mayor Claes Nordmark. ""This will mean jobs, it will mean more restaurants, it will bring more sponsorship to our football and ice hockey and handball team and so onâ¦ it means everything for us."" Â© 2023 BBC.

Police were called to Little Creek Elementary School in the city of Norfolk on Thursday afternoon, where staff gave them the handgun.  No-one was injured, but one mother says the boy threatened to shoot her daughter in class. Last month another six-year-old shot and wounded his teacher in the state. In the latest incident, the boy's mother was charged on Friday with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and allowing access to a loaded firearm by children. The BBC is not naming her to protect the child's identity. Another mother told a local news station that the boy had brought a loaded gun to school in his backpack and threatened to shoot her daughter during physical education class on Thursday. But the woman only found out about the threat from another parent.  Her daughter did not tell her because she thought she might get in trouble. The girl told the broadcaster that after coming home from school she went to her bedroom ""and tried to play but couldn't"". The incident echoes the case of a six-year-old boy who brought a gun to class nearby in Newport News, Virginia, on 6 January with near-fatal consequences.

It's also the same route that amateur social media sleuths take when they come to look into the case themselves. They have been turning up in their numbers, prompted by rumours, speculation and conspiracy on social media viewed and shared by millions of people who have never been anywhere near this village.  The previous day, my TikTok feed had been recommended a clip of one of Nicola's friends appealing for her safe return. But the words ""crisis actor"" - a term used to describe someone who has been paid to act out a tragedy or scenario - had been added by someone else in large font.  My TikTok ""For You Page"" had been awash with videos speculating about Nicola's disappearance, recommended by TikTok's algorithm because I've shown an interest in them. But in recent days, these have escalated, and had widened out to include conspiracy theories suggesting the disappearance has been staged by the government or other sinister forces. Hence the video about friends ""acting"" I had been recommended.  I have previously covered how conspiracy theorists and trolls target survivors of terror attacks - like the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017 - with some going far as to track them down offline to find out if they were lying about their injuries.  This case is very different, but there has been drastic spiralling of speculation and conspiracy theories, which has triggered statements from Nicola's family, and police who issued a dispersal order.  This story has been a huge focus for the media, splashed on front pages daily. But I want to understand the scale of the social media frenzy.  Metres from the bench where Nicola's phone was found, I bump into Jack and Stevie. The 20-year-old builders from Darlington have been putting up fencing in the area. But, having finished early for the day, they tell me the social media frenzy has led them down to the river bank.  ""It's all through TikTok,"" Jack tells me. ""[I saw] one video about it and thought I want to look deeper and deeper into it. So you get caught in that loop of looking and looking, and it interests you more and more as you go on."" Stevie agrees. He wants to know about ""different scenarios and what people think"". In his view interest in the case is still picking up steam on social media, rather than waning.  They head off, phones at the ready, to poke around the outside of a derelict out-house along the river bank. Neither post their own videos, and they don't agree with the more extreme conspiracies. Nonetheless, they say they find the social media posts compelling. In the hours I spend near the bench, I meet others who have come here for the same reason. There's a dad and son who are visiting the scene during the school holidays - filming while they explore. Another pair arrive with two husky dogs, and tell me they've bought them to search the fields near the river.   Tourists travelling to scenes of disappearances are nothing new - nor are true crime sleuths online. But the frenzy on social media - and TikTok in particular - seems to be sucking in a huge number of people.  As of Friday 17 February, when I checked TikTok, videos discussing Nicola Bulley's case since she first disappeared and using her name as a hashtag have accumulated more than 270 million views. In comparison, posts and videos using these same phrases on other major social media sites have had less traction. Over the same period, I discovered that Instagram ""reels"" using Nicola Bulley's name have had more than 158 million views, and posts have had around 115,000 interactions - likes, follows and comments. On YouTube, videos I found using the same term have racked up 3.3 million views in total, while on Twitter my analysis of mentions and their potential reach estimates just under 21 million views.  On Facebook, where it's not possible to assess views easily, I found around 8,500 publicly-available posts on the term with over two million interactions on posts. Facebook groups dedicated to Nicola Bulley have more than 81,000 members, many sharing speculation about the case.  At a news conference this week, Lancashire police singled out ""TikTok-ers"" whom they said had ""been playing their own private detectives"". They said social media speculation has been a hindrance to their investigation, with Det Supt Becky Smith saying she had ""never seen anything like it"" in 29 years of working for the police.  TikTok videos I found suggesting Nicola Bulley's friends and family could be ""crisis actors"" staging events, questioning whether Nicola is real and alleging the case has been created as a ""distraction"" by the government have accumulated more than 1.5 million views.  These same conspiracies haven't accumulated as much attention on the other major social media sites. On Twitter, I found eight publicly available tweets that mention ""crisis actors"" and government distractions, with more than 65,500 views according to the site's own data.  On Facebook, I found two public posts pushing them with only about 150 interactions - and on Instagram and YouTube, I found no relevant posts when I searched using the same terms.  Caroline, who lives in a town nearby, says she has seen hundreds of TikTok videos pushing these false suggestions, some which have been recommended to her.  ""Some of the things they point out in the videos make you think maybe they are onto something,"" she says.  ""Then I give myself a wake-up and think why would they actually be doing that? What would they be acting for? What are we being distracted from?"" She was first recommended TikTok videos three days after Nicola disappeared. Since then, she's been hooked - and her own output, once dedicated to dancing with her kids, is now punctuated with clips of her speculating about Nicola. She wants to take part.  In one, Caroline calls out a false rumour about arrests in the case. But in another, she shares a clip that shows a TikTok influencer called Dan Duffy live-streaming on the app as he tries to enter a house on the other side of the river to where Bulley was last spotted.  ""Being a mum myself I think it's nice to see people sharing hoping it might just trigger someone to come forward,"" she tells me. ""I also think that people trying to help search for anything that may locate Nicola's whereabouts is great also."" The house in Duffy's video has been at the centre of many rumours on social media, so much so that police stated that they had searched it three times. Comments on Duffy's live stream encouraged him to carry on, and even call out Nicola's name. Duffy was later arrested and fined by the police for a public order offence. TikTok also removed his account.   A statement from TikTok said that its ""thoughts are with Ms Bulley's family and friends at this difficult time"" . It says it ""does not tolerate bullying or harassment on TikTok and we remove content that violates our policies"". It also revealed it is ""deploying additional resources to reduce the potential spread of conspiratorial content about unfolding events by making it ineligible for recommendation to the For You feed"".  A local dog walker, who doesn't want to be named over fears of backlash online, says he was outraged when he watched Duffy's livestream. He says he's seen people coming to the site, driven by social media.  He describes crowds of people and TikTokers filming the scene of the disappearance, including bringing children along and trying to climb fences.  ""It's really difficult to hear [these conspiracy theories]. It's down to the police to investigate, not TikTokers,"" he says. Frustrated locals have resorted to hiring local security to try to keep people away from their property. This isn't just about social media. An absence of information, news that leaves us frightened or shocked and distrust are essential ingredients for rumour and conspiracy to thrive. Police have been criticised in recent days for their handling of the case.  There's also a huge amount of media interest, too. Rumours circulating online find their way into newspapers and new sites.  Then there's the legacy left by the boom of pandemic disinformation.  Research for the BBC by King's College London suggests that the pandemic has created a ""gateway"" for conspiracy theories denying that tragic events have happened, and calling people ""crisis actors"".  A significant number of people hyper-engaged on social media - with its powerful algorithms - and well-versed in this conspiracy lexicon are being presented with a disappearance at a time when trust in institutions, and the police, is low -  providing a perfect storm.

72,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Why is the UK economy lagging behind the US, Germany and others?",Projections suggest the UK recovering slower than other countries - and the reasons go beyond Brexit.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64661791,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/113D8/production/_128661607_mediaitem128663197.jpg,2023-02-18T00:23:36Z,"The UK economy is struggling - and people are feeling it in their pockets, as wages fail to keep up with rising prices. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the UK economy will shrink this year while every other major economy will grow.  The Bank of England also forecasts a recession in the UK in 2023 - albeit one that is shorter and less severe than previously forecast. Perhaps it's not surprising the outlook is bleak given the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and soaring costs of both energy and food. But why is the UK seemingly faring worse than other rich countries such as the US, Germany and France? Forecasts are never perfect. There are so many factors that affect economic growth - from geopolitics to the weather - that, inevitably, predictions often miss the mark. But they can point in the right direction. And the existing evidence shows other countries have taken less of a hit from the huge challenges of recent years than the UK has. Figures from the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which looks at how rich countries are performing, show the UK economy fell further than others in the first months of the pandemic.  The UK's pace of recovery was fast once the economy reopened - but not fast enough to make up the lost ground.  But the difference between the UK and others may not be quite as big as it appears. That's because most countries measure the output of their public services, such as health and education, based on the costs - a nurse's wage, for example. In the UK they are accounted for differently, by valuing the services delivered - such as operations in hospital. As a result, the UK's figures better reflect the impact of closed schools and cancelled operations during Covid, as well as disruption due to strikes. The bigger picture, however, remains: the Bank of England and the IMF both expect the UK economy to shrink this year, while other G7 countries are expected to grow. Some observers, including pro-Brexit economist Julian Jessop, believe the IMF was overly gloomy about the UK's prospects and that the differences under discussion - a percentage point here or there - are small. Nevertheless, he says, there is still definitely ""something to explain"" about the UK's flagging economic performance. Estimates about the cost of Brexit vary - according to a report by Bloomberg it is costing the UK economy roughly Â£100bn a year, and the economy is 4% smaller than it might have been if the UK had stayed in the EU. ""The EU is a very rich part of the world,"" says Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent think tank. ""And we've chosen, for better or worse, to make trade with that grouping of countries a lot more difficult, so it's clearly going to be something that makes it harder for the UK economy to grow."" Business investment has stagnated since the referendum vote in 2016 too, he says - another ""drag on growth"". A Bank of England policymaker has said that Brexit hit UK investment to the tune of Â£29bn. EU workers used to come freely to work in the UK but can no longer do so, making it hard for the hospitality, agriculture, and care sectors to find enough staff.  Julian Jessop is a fellow at the free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs and describes himself as a ""Brexit optimist"". He believes there are big potential gains from leaving the EU, but agrees there have been short-term economic costs. ""We're still in a sort of transition phase, where the negatives are dominating,"" he says.  But he says those negatives are ""smaller than people have been arguing"" and ""more likely to be temporary, because a lot of them have to do with uncertainty and the process of adjustment"". Energy costs  Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent global energy prices soaring - but the impact varies between countries. The US has its own domestic sources of fossil fuels and some European countries have more alternative sources of energy, Mr Emmerson says. France, for example, has a large nuclear network, and Norway has significant hydropower.  ""Britain is pretty exposed,"" he says. Moreover, the way the UK prices electricity is based on the cost of gas, the most expensive form of electricity generation. That has pushed up bills across the economy and made inflation worse, Mr Jessop says. Workforce shortages Most economies saw their workforce shrink during the pandemic. But again, the UK is an outlier, with numbers failing to bounce back after the crisis.  Economists are still trying to work out why. It seems it is not just down to having fewer EU workers.  Young people have opted to study rather than work, older people have retired early, and more people are receiving long-term sickness benefits.  There are signs the workforce is starting to grow again, which could help boost growth and tax revenues later this year. There are also more fundamental reasons behind the UK's weaker performance, suggests Cambridge University economist Diane Coyle. While the economy has slowed since the financial crisis in 2008, the roots of the problems go back much further, she argues, with investment in decline since the 1990s. That left the economy lacking the resilience to cope with the triple shocks of Covid, Brexit and the war in Ukraine. ""That's down to the long-term weaknesses, long-term under investment, in the private and the public sector, [and] degradation of public services and infrastructure, which are just essential if the economy is going to grow,"" she says. For its part, the government says the UK economy is resilient.  Responding to figures showing that the UK narrowly avoided a recession in 2022, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the numbers showed ""underlying resilience"" - but added the country was ""not out of the woods"".

73,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,The protesters who've gone missing as China deepens crackdown,Police have quietly gone after those who took part in the November protests that shook China.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64592333,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/100A/production/_128660140_gettyimages-1445031651.jpg,2023-02-18T22:09:25Z,"As China declares victory over the pandemic, the landmark protests in November which spelled the end for zero-Covid rules have begun fading from memory. But as the country moved on, many of those who took part in the demonstrations went missing, taken by authorities in a quietly deepening crackdown on dissenters. Thousands rallied against restrictive Covid policies in the so-called White Paper protests, holding up blank white sheets in the dark. It was a rare show of criticism of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping. Police made few arrests at the time. Now, months on, scores of those protesters are in police custody, say Chinese activists, with one group estimating there have been more than 100 arrests. International rights groups and foreign universities have called for their release. And activist groups have published lists naming the alleged detainees. This includes those who protested in Beijing as well as other cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Nanjing.  Chinese authorities have not responded to queries on the detentions. But through interviews with friends and lawyers, the BBC was able to verify the names of 12 people arrested in Beijing.  At least five of them have been released on bail. Among those still in custody, four women - Cao Zhixin, Li Siqi, Li Yuanjing and Zhai Dengrui - have been formally arrested for ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble"". This is a notoriously vague charge that carries a maximum sentence of five years, and one which critics say is often used to stifle dissent.  Many of those arrested are well-educated - some attended universities in the UK and the US - and they include writers, journalists, a musician, a teacher and a financial industry professional.  Most of the Beijing detainees were part of a loose network of friends who shared a love for the arts and often met at book clubs, movie screenings and discussions. Many of them are women, and according to reports, police have questioned them about whether they were feminists or involved in ""feminist activities"". Chinese authorities have increasingly cracked down on or censored women's rights activists in recent years. Though the group was socially conscious, and some members had shown support for #MeToo figure Xianzi, they were not activists, their friends insisted. ""They are just a group of young people concerned about societyâ¦ my friend is interested not just in women's rights, but also human rights and the rights of the vulnerable. This has nothing to do with feminist-related activities,"" said one of the detainees' friends.  On 27 November, several women from the group had joined a public vigil at Liangma River in Beijing.  The event was one of many spontaneously held across China that night to mourn the victims of an apartment fire in Urumqi which had shocked China - many believed the victims could not escape because of Covid restrictions, though authorities disputed this. The vigil turned into a peaceful protest, with people holding blank pieces of paper that became a symbol of their frustration. ""The environment has been so oppressive for so long. They didn't think they were participating in a movement when they went. They thought it was just a way to vent their emotions,"" another friend said. ""They didn't clash with police or express radical opinions. So they didn't think it was serious.""  So much so that their friends say they did little to protect their identities, given how swiftly China is known to silence protests.  It's unclear what led police to this particular group of friends, but they have reportedly tracked down protesters using surveillance cameras and facial recognition software, and searched the phones of those arrested. One of the detainees created a Telegram group which expanded from several members to more than 60. And many of them used phone numbers registered under their real names. Two days later, some of them were questioned by police.  ""We were talking on the phone when she was being taken away,"" said the boyfriend of one detainee. ""She told me some of her friends were being taken away and lost contact. She was trying to delete stuff from her mobile phone. She was taken away before she finished deleting things."" The arrests appeared to accelerate through December and January as, one by one, more friends were detained, according to activists. Cao Zhixin, in anticipation of her arrest, sent her friends a video of herself speaking to the camera. It came with the instructions to publish it online in the event of her disappearance. ""What we did was express our feelings in a reasonable way,"" Ms Cao said in the clip, which has now gone viral. ""We don't want to disappearâ¦ if attending a mourning event is a crime, how much room is left for sharing our feelings? Several human rights groups and educational institutions are now calling for their release in a sign of growing international concern. British university Goldsmiths confirmed to the BBC that Li Siqi was a former student, and said it was ""deeply concerned"" for her welfare. ""We condemn in the strongest terms the suppression of free speech and urge the Chinese authorities to immediately release all those who are being detained in relation to the vigil,"" a Goldsmiths spokeswoman said. She added that the university's warden had written to the Chinese ambassador to the UK, Zheng Zeguang. The Chinese embassy is yet to respond to queries from the BBC. The University of Chicago and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) also confirmed that their former students had been arrested. A UNSW statement to the BBC called for the matter to be resolved with ""due respect for legal principles and for universal human rights"".  Reporters Without Borders noted that four of the detainees including Li Siqi were journalists, and called their arrests ""one more chilling message to those who believe that factual information should be reported even when it contradicts the official narrative"". Human Rights Watch said the incident showed that ""young people in China are paying a heavy price for daring to speak out for freedom and human rights"", adding that Chinese authorities have threatened lawyers and friends who have tried to support the detainees. Observers believe authorities want to send a signal with the arrests, or what rights activist Teng Biao calls ""killing the chicken to scare the monkeys"". ""They want to get who they believe are the leaders and organisers, and those who play a leading role will be severely punished,"" he said, adding that the Chinese authorities' instinct will be to find out if ""Western hostile forces"" were behind the protests. The fact that a significant number of the detainees are women, and have been reportedly questioned about supporting feminist causes, also underscores the officials' distrust of the women's rights movement. China in recent years has been roiled by several high-profile cases involving female victims of violence and sexual assault. These have triggered unusually harsh criticism of the authorities and have marshalled support for women's rights.  But as the movement grows, the government's response has hardened. In 2015, it cracked down on a group of women known as the Feminist Five, and since then activists say they have been increasingly censored and attacked online. An arm of the Chinese Communist Party recently condemned ""extreme feminism"" as an ""malignant tumour"". ""Maintaining 'social harmony' has always been the government's top priority, and feminist movements have always been considered a threat to the stability of the entire political system,"" said Altman Peng, an assistant professor at the University of Warwick who studies Chinese gender power relations. It is unclear what lies ahead for the protesters.  Those out on bail are still liable to be charged. Those who remain in custody could be detained for several weeks as prosecutors decide whether to charge them - but that could stretch to months, if not years, in political cases, according to Mr Teng. Their families have so far remained silent, and some have cut off contact with the detainees' friends. The BBC has learnt that one family also dropped a lawyer they had hired to fight their daughter's case, although it is not clear why. The detainees' families are likely to stay silent given the immense pressure they are under, says veteran rights activist Yang Zhanqing. ""The police has a carrot and stick approach. Authorities would tell the families that those arrested would be released early if they kept silent. If they didn't comply, they would lose their jobs and pension.""  But increasing international scrutiny of the detentions may also aid those in custody. In such politically sensitive cases, detainees can be released early or receive better treatment in jail because of external pressure, Mr Yang says.  Meanwhile, friends of the detainees, anxious and worried for their own personal safety, continue to keep tabs on the situation and share information.  Many of them live overseas and did not attend the November protests, but they fear they may be targeted anyway because of their association with the detainees - and their attempts to raise international awareness of their friends' plight.  Recently, they circulated a message from one of the detainees, relayed to them from prison. She sought to reassure her friends, making it clear the detainees were keeping their spirits up. ""[Our interrogators] keep making us feel that we are surrounded by friends who are traitors, or who have betrayed us,"" she said. ""But I still believe we stand together."" Some names have been withheld to protect the identity of those who fear reprisal from officials. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Officials said a building was hit in the central Kafr Sousa neighbourhood, killing four civilians and one soldier.  The densely populated district is home to a large, heavily guarded security complex.  Israel's military declined to comment on the strike when approached by Reuters news agency. Israel frequently attacks targets in Syria linked to Iran and Hezbollah militants but rarely acknowledges its actions. Sunday's attack was the first since a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck the north-west of the country, as well as parts of neighbouring Turkey, 12 days ago. The Kafr Sousa area is home to senior officials and security agencies, but also civilians living in residential buildings. The strike - which hit at 00:22 local time (21:22 GMT) - caused damage to several homes in Damascus neighbourhoods and other nearby areas, Syrian officials said. The country's defence ministry said the rockets were launched from the Golan Heights, a rocky plateau south-west of Damascus which was annexed by Israel in 1981. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at 15 people, including civilians. ""The strike on Sunday is the deadliest Israeli attack in the Syrian capital,"" said Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the observatory. It comes over a month after an Israeli strike hit Damascus's international airport, according to the Syrian army, killing four people including two soldiers. Israel has previously acknowledged that it targets the bases of militant groups loyal to Iran.  The two countries are arch-foes and in recent years have been engaged in what has been described as a ""shadow war"" of unclaimed attacks on each other's assets, infrastructure and nationals.

Ukraine has launched an investigation into the cause of the crash, but it could take weeks. The BBC has been piecing together what we know and what we don't know in the immediate aftermath of the disaster.  BBC Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse has been reporting from the crash site at Brovary, a suburb on the eastern edge of Kyiv. At the site, near to a kindergarten, he saw wreckage of the aircraft - a door panel and one of the rotors - along with three bodies covered in foil blankets. A video of the aftermath of the crash, verified by the BBC, shows flames and smoke across a wide area between high-rise flats and another residential block. Photos also show the nearby kindergarten blackened by smoke. Ukrainian officials said the glazing of a 14-storey residential building was damaged along with three cars, while the National Emergency Service building was also damaged by the fire. An eyewitness said she heard ""such a noise"" before seeing ""a terrible flame"" and a helicopter ""circling above our home"". She said the burning helicopter headed towards one of the smaller buildings in the area. An analysis of images of the crash site by the BBC has not revealed any evidence of missile debris, and Ukrainian officials have made no mention of any missile fire.  The news agency Reuters quoted a Ukraine Air Force spokesman telling a TV broadcast that it was too early to talk about the causes. But the spokesman added: ""Unfortunately, the sky does not forgive mistakes"". The helicopter crashed at about 08:20 local time (06:20 GMT), just half an hour after sunrise, according to officials. Several videos show cloudy and misty conditions. It is thought it was travelling east towards the front line. Volodymyr Tymoshko, the head of police in the eastern city of Kharkiv, said in a Facebook post that he was due to meet the officials on board today. However, we don't know the route the flight took before it came down as data from its location tracking device would have been blocked to avoid detection.  We have been trying to geolocate other videos purportedly of the helicopter before the crash to establish its route, but have not yet been able to verify them. We don't know how high the helicopter was flying before it got into trouble, but the BBC's James Waterhouse says helicopters travelling towards the front line often fly at very low altitudes to avoid detection by the enemy. ""We've taken similar trips with ministers, it involved hugging treelines and occasionally vaulting over electricity pylons,"" he says. Some analysts have noted there are overhead cables between buildings surrounding the crash site, which may have posed a danger to very low-flying aircraft. However, reporting from the scene, our correspondent says he has not seen any damaged cables in the area. Ukrainian officials say the helicopter was a Eurocopter EC225 Super Puma used by the State Emergency Service. Red and white debris matching images of these helicopters can be seen in photos of the crash site. This is not a military helicopter used in combat, and it's often used to transport members of the Ukrainian government.  Reporting team: Daniele Palumbo, Joshua Cheetham and Jake Horton Â© 2023 BBC.

A court in the Philippines has acquitted the journalist and her news outlet Rappler of tax evasion, in a move hailed as a win for press freedom. In an interview for the BBC, she talks about what she calls the ""weaponisation of the law"" against her - and how it took more than four years to get to this point.  ""This is a day that we had hoped would happen sooner,"" she told me over zoom from Manila - beaming smiles as she spoke.  ""And you know, it went down to these three things, facts, truth and justice. That is who won today."" Under former president Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine government had accused Ms Ressa and Rappler of evading tax payments when it raised capital through its partnership with foreign investors. Ms Ressa and Rappler denied the charges. Rappler had been one of the few Philippine media organisations to be openly critical of Mr Duterte and his policies. The Philippines' National Union of Journalists said the tax evasion case reflected an increasing use of law for reprisal and intimidation against journalists and civil society. But it hasn't been an easy road, and there's still a tough battle ahead. Ms Ressa is acutely aware of the trials she has yet to face, but draws her inspiration from those who have gone before her.  ""You know, Martin Luther King says, yes - it will take time,"" she said. ""But as I was reading through the decision, and there was no reason to take us to court... we're not tax evaders - we never wereâ¦ This was an incredibly important day because it would have set a direction for which way the Philippines was going."" Maria Ressa's legal problems started while Mr Duterte's administration was in power, and continued into the current President Ferdinand Marcos Junior's time.  Does she think things are changing now, under his rule?  ""Our president is in Davos today speaking to business leaders,"" she muses. ""So it is, it's a great signal to bring about where the Philippines is. We still have a ways to go - the fight isn't over. And can I go to jail? I hope not. I'll knock on wood, you know, but I was ready for either decision."" It's clear that Maria Ressa is up for the fight - she still has several cases against her, and faces significant prison sentences for them - those legal challenges are looming.  The last four years have taken their toll on her family, especially her parents. But as she puts it, it's par for the course in this job. ""It's like being in a conflict area - being in a war zone. It's just long, right?"" Ms Ressa's enthusiasm and optimism are infectious - but behind the beaming smiles and much deserved relief is a palpable sense of injustice.  This is not just directed at the system that could have potentially put her behind bars, but at social media firms that she feels are partially to blame for the scourge of fake news in the Philippines - something she says is responsible for so many of the country's problems today.  ""The world as we knew it has been completely destroyed,"" she tells me. ""Are you on TikTok? Because I talk about Facebook as a mallet for our minds, but TikTok as a surgical probe.  ""Imagine if you're in high school and you're trying to curate your life for a feedâ¦ that could turn into a mobâ¦ What types of values do you have? I worry about the next generation."" So what would she say to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg if she could sit down with him face to face?  Ms Ressa doesn't miss a beat.  ""Draw your lines, Mark,"" she exclaims. ""In Americaâ¦ you prioritise your shareholders. But there is a line between amoral, immoral and evil. And you have to know when when you cross those lines, when what you have created inspires autocracy, and fascism inspires violence, enables genocide."" Â© 2023 BBC.

Scientists say big cuts in CO2 emissions won't be enough to limit global warming.  And nature alone will not remove enough of it from the air. CO2 is the most important gas warming the planet, and is emitted when fossil fuels such as gas and oil are burnt. ""To limit warming to 2C or lower, we need to accelerate emissions reductions. But the findings of this report are clear: we also need to increase carbon removal too,"" says lead author Dr Steve Smith from Oxford University. ""Many new methods are emerging with potential."" There's consensus among scientists that the world is warming primarily because emissions of CO2 (estimated at 33 billion tonnes in 2021) far exceed the amount that is being removed (this report suggests two billion tonnes a year).  Until emissions and removals are balanced - so called ""net-zero"" - global temperatures are predicted to rise. But getting there won't be easy. The latest UN climate reports say to fully achieve ""net zero"" there will need to be some CO2 removal, so called ""negative emissions"", to compensate for sectors that can't easily decarbonise.  Currently almost all of the world's CO2 removal occurs through natural processes. That's primarily plants and trees taking in CO2 from the air, and the soil absorbing and storing it.  But there are limits to how much nature can do. For example, how much more of the world can realistically be given over to forests? Some optimistic scenarios suggest that natural CO2 removal could be doubled by 2050, but that's still only about 4 billion tonnes of CO2 a year.  This new report titled ""The State of Carbon Dioxide Removal"" says that to restrict and reduce global temperatures in the future there needs to be investment in developing technological solutions now.  The methods it cites are all fairly new, and at different stages of development and deployment. Put together they currently only make up a tiny fraction of the worlds CO2 removal. One, known as BECCS, involves incorporating CO2 capture into biomass-based electricity-generation, in which organic matter such as crops and wood pellets are burned to produce power. Other options include: huge facilities where the carbon is extracted from the air before being stored in the ground; the use of specially treated charcoal (biochar) that locks in carbon; and  ""enhanced rock weathering"" - loosely based on the carbon removal that occurs with natural erosion.  The use of CO2 removal technologies is not without its critics. Some campaigners doubt that they can be cost effective and fear   that they can be an excuse to defer and delay the transition away from fossil fuel use. This report stresses that removing CO2 should not be seen as a ""silver bullet"" to tackle climate change but that meeting the UN's climate goals will require technology as well as nature to reduce greenhouse gas levels.  That all assumes that global CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels will, as pledged at numerous climate summits, fall rapidly. So far yearly emissions have yet to start a downward trend.

They celebrated the impact of footballer and anti-poverty campaigner Marcus Rashford at a community centre near his childhood home in Wythenshawe. The Manchester United and England star, who is due to play against Arsenal this Sunday, was unable to attend.  Camilla unveiled bookshelves named in honour of Rashford, who promotes reading through his book club. An avid reader herself, she met author Alex Falase-Koya - who co-wrote The Breakfast Club Adventures with Rashford - and local children who took part in a writing session.  Rashford became an MBE after his campaign for free school meals during school holidays led to a change in government policy during the 2020 coronavirus lockdowns.   The monarch joined Southgate, who is also a Prince's Trust ambassador, meeting youngsters taking part in leadership and entrepreneurial schemes. Earlier in the day, King Charles visited the offices of the UK's intelligence, security and cyber agency GCHQ. He met staff and schoolchildren learning codebreaking skills at the hub, which opened in Manchester city centre in 2019. He also visited the world's biggest corn flakes factory at the Kellogg's site in Trafford Park. The event marked a century since the US firm introduced its cereals to the UK in 1922. King Charles, who unveiled a plaque, sparked laughter when he joked: ""Sorry, I'm a year late.""  Kellogg's has been a holder of the Royal Warrant - which enables a firm to trade with the Royal Household and use the Royal Arms - since the reign of the King's grandfather George VI. In the 1980s, its cereals were delivered to Buckingham Palace in a small van named Genevieve.  Chatting to workers at Europe's largest cereal factory the King described the sweet molasses as ""very special"". The King and Camilla also visited Bolton Town Hall in their first official joint appearance since the Duke of Sussex's controversial book Spare was published earlier this month. They met local groups in a celebration marking 150 years since 150,000 people attended the town hall's 1873 opening by the King's great-great grandfather, who later became King Edward VII. They were also shown the famous artwork Going to the Match by LS Lowry, who was inspired by Bolton Wanderers' Burnden Park ground. The painting has recently returned to public display in Salford after it was auctioned for a record-breaking Â£7.8m.      King Charles arrived in Manchester after travelling on the royal train for the first time since his reign began, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September.

Governor Ron DeSantis' administration said the proposed course ""lacks educational value and is contrary to Florida law"".  The course is being rolled out in a pilot programme by the US College Board to 60 high schools across the country.  Officials did not specify what law the course breaks.  The Florida Department of Education outlined its intent to block the course in a 12 January letter to the College Board, writing that the course violates state law.  ""In the future, should the College Board be willing to come back to the table with lawful, historically accurate content, (the Department of Education) will always be willing to reopen the discussion,"" the letter said. The Advanced Placement (AP) African American studies course is the College Board's first new class since 2014. It is set to cover more than 400 years of African American history, touching on topics like literature, political science and geography.  The course is part of a broader AP programme in US high schools, which gives students the chance to take college-level courses before graduation.  A statement by a spokesperson for Florida's Republican governor DeSantis said the course ""leaves large, ambiguous gaps that can be filled with additional ideological material, which we will not allow"". ""If the College Board amends the course to comply, provides a full course curriculum, and incorporates historically accurate content, then the Department will reconsider the course for approval,"" said spokesperson Bryan Griffin in a statement to media.  In response, the College Board said the course is ""undergoing a rigorous, multi-year pilot phase, collecting feedback from teachers, students, scholars and policymakers"".  ""We look forward to bringing this rich and inspiring exploration of African-American history and culture to students across the country,"" the board said. The decision to block the African American studies course has been met with outrage from the National Parents Union, who said the ban is a ""direct attack on the Black and all (Black, Indigenous and Persons of Colour) communities"".  ""This behaviour is dangerous and should concern every American,"" the organisation said, adding they will challenge the decision.  The ban was also criticised by Florida's state senator and Democrat Shevrin Jones, who wrote on Twitter that other AP courses, like European History and several language and culture courses, are still being taught in the state. ""It's crazy how AP African-American studies made the chopping block in FL,"" Mr Jones wrote.  Last year, Gov DeSantis passed a ""Stop WOKE"" act that regulates how lessons on race and gender are taught in Florida schools. ""In Florida, we are taking a stand against the state-sanctioned racism that is critical race theory,"" Mr DeSantis said, citing the academic framework that denotes the existence of systemic racism in American society.  However, one of the developers of the AP African American studies course had previously told Time magazine that the class does not teach ""critical race theory"".  Rather, Henry-Louis Gates Jr, a leading scholar on African American history in the US, said the course ""is a mainstream, rigorously vetted, academic approach to a vibrant field of study"".  Ron DeSantis has been assembling the kind of record on hot-button conservative issues that could form the core of a presidential campaign later this year. He repeatedly criticised government mandates to control the spread of Covid-19 and has expanded his attacks to include the development of the coronavirus vaccines. He railed against big corporations, including Florida powerhouse Disney, for catering to liberal interests and ideologies. He's accused social media companies of bias against conservatives.  The topic Mr DeSantis appears most focused on, however, is education. He enthusiastically backed state legislation limiting the ability of school teachers to talk about LGBTQ issues in their classrooms. He's supported conservative candidates for local education boards and appointed controversial conservative activists as university trustees. He's called for a ban on transgender athletes in interscholastic competitions.  His latest move, blocking the use of an advanced African American Studies curriculum in Florida public high schools, is just one piece of this larger puzzle. If Mr DeSantis runs for president, his pitch to primary voters is that he is the Republican who takes real action on conservative concerns- the kind of culture-war red meat that is a staple on right-wing media outlets.

It is nearly four months since Russian troops were forced to retreat from here, pushed back some 25km (about 15 miles) to the east. But the boom of artillery fire, close to the front lines, is still audible every few minutes, and this town - much of it in ruins - is not yet safe from Russian missiles. ""I live on the seventh floor. The rocket hit the fifth floor, early this morning, at around five. But I'm fine,"" says Alexander Rogovitz, a 73-year-old retired businessman and the only remaining resident of a large apartment block on the edge of town.  He bends over to share out some dried food to the eight cats - seven of them strays, abandoned by neighbours - he now looks after. That resilience, and a strong collective spirit, seem to be widespread here, among those who have clung on amid the snow and rubble. In a nearby courtyard, beside a giant bomb crater, a 45-year-old railway technician named Valeri Dmitrenko is busy chopping wood to heat the basement where he and 21 neighbours have been sheltering for the past nine months. Lyman still has no running water or central heating system, and the daytime temperature has been hovering around freezing. ""What can we do?"" Valeri shrugs, stroking the head of a stray dog he and his wife, Ira, recently adopted and named Princess Diana. When he's not busy with his axe, Valeri helps neighbours repair broken doors and windows in their badly damaged apartment building. Ira walks past, hurriedly, with buckets of water she has pumped from a well in the yard. ""I still find it stressful to stay outside, in the open, for long,"" says Ira, a 41-year-old accountant, before heading down a dark flight of stairs and into the cramped cellar of 6 Railway Street. Despite heavy fighting continuing in the Donbas, civilians are trickling back to liberated Ukrainian towns close to the front line - against the advice of local authorities. In Lyman, devastated by Russian forces last year, some 13,000 residents are living, precariously, in gruelling winter conditions. As Russia's forces approached Lyman last June, 41,000 civilians fled, leaving about 10,000 people behind. Many of those were elderly, or poor - or, like Ira and Valeri, had sick relatives who refused to leave. For the next four months, about 60 people squeezed into the same cellar on Railway Street. ""It was difficult at times. People are different. Some became aggressive - we're not used to living all together like this,"" says Ira. Adding to that stress was the fact that, by Ira's reckoning, about a third of those who had chosen to stay in the cellar were pro-Russian, actively hoping that Ukraine would lose the war. ""Yes, there were people who supported Russia. But they left when Ukraine started liberating territory. When the so-called Russian authorities moved out, they went with them, taking their children. Probably because they were scared of what would happen to them here,"" adds Ira. On 3 October, Lyman was liberated by Ukrainian forces and soon afterwards the town's mayor, Alexander Zhuravlov, returned to discover that ""80%, maybe 90%"" of the buildings had been damaged or destroyed. The railway lines that pass through the centre of town are still a mass of broken overhead cables and blocked tracks. In recent months, the mayor and his team have managed to restore electricity to most of the town and the surrounding villages. Pensions are now being paid, on time, and some shops have reopened.  The government and humanitarian groups have brought in wood stoves and distributed logs. Every day one aid group brings in hundreds of packed lunches to distribute free of charge. There are roughly 700 children living in Lyman and the mayor estimates that another 3,000 residents have returned since the town was liberated. But he's urging the rest to stay away. ""At the moment we do not recommend people to return here. On the contrary, they're better off in safer places and cities. There are no comfortable living places here, for now. People will be accepted in other regions and will be provided with accommodation and food,"" he says, driving to the site of a two-week-old missile attack that ripped the entire wall off a nine-storey apartment block. The mayor says local police are still dealing with ""a handful"" of Lyman's residents suspected of working for the Russian occupiers. But he believes the experience of the past year has persuaded many pro-Russian residents to change their views. ""I think those people now understand that they made a mistake. They were led astray by the media - watching Russian propaganda on television every night and thinking it was the truth. They were in a minority, and they have already changed their minds. They see that this Russian world is not the one they'd been led to expect,"" says Zhuravlyov. A 62-year-old woman called Valentina, queueing for food at the local hospital, seems to reflect that change of heart, when asked about the security situation in Lyman since it was liberated. In recent months, pro-Russian civilians have often hinted at their allegiance by implying that both sides are equally guilty of shelling towns, and that it is therefore impossible to assign blame. ""The bombardment hasn't stopped. The shells still hit the town. We don't know who is firing,"" she begins. But then, unprompted, Valentina changes her mind. ""I suppose it must be the Russians. Yes, no doubt,"" she says, adding: ""We're Ukrainians. This is a Ukrainian town. The shops are open. Our pensions come on time. The state has not abandoned us."" Â© 2023 BBC.

Mohe - known as ""China's North Pole"" - is in the province of Heilongjiang, close to the Russian border. On Sunday, its local meteorological station recorded a record-low temperature of -53C (-63F) at 7am. The previous coldest temperature on record in the city was -52.3C, in 1969.  However, the temperature is probably still shy of China's national record. The coldest temperature ever recorded in China is -58C, in the city of Genhe, Inner Mongolia in December 2009, according to media reports of a visit by government meteorologists. Other records, however, have the 1969 cold snap in Mohe as the lowest - meaning Sunday's -53C temperature could be China's lowest ever. By contrast, the lowest temperature recorded in the UK is -27.2C, set in different parts of Scotland in 1895, 1982 and 1995. Mohe is no stranger to cold weather: China Daily says the city is regarded as the coldest  in China, and that its winter period ""usually lasts eight months"".  As a result, it attracts tourists throughout the year with its ""North Pole"", ice and snow parks, and skiing venues. In previous years, it has also hosted winter marathons.   This time of year, it is common for the city to see average temperatures of -15C.   In the past week, China's meteorological authority issued alerts for plunging temperatures and cold winds in the region.  The Xinhua News Agency said a number of areas in the Greater Khingan mountain range, which spans Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang, saw new record low temperatures over the weekend.   Since Friday, temperatures dipped below -50C in Mohe for three consecutive days, which outlets have said is unprecedented.   Beijing News reported on Friday that coal consumption has increased by a third in the city, as the cold weather bites.   Car companies also told the paper they had taken advantage of the cold to test the braking performance of vehicles.   One resident told Kanji Video that his hands had been numb within 10 seconds of stepping outdoors, but that he had seen very few other people around.   ""It becomes hazy about 100m in front of you, you can't see anyone,"" he said. A tourist, surnamed Li, told Beijing News that he had made a special trip from China's southernmost province, Guangdong, to experience the extreme weather.  ""I didn't expect it to get below -50C this year, it was quite a surprise,"" he told the paper.  Meanwhile, the official broadcaster, CCTV, showed a journalist breaking an egg on an outdoor surface - causing the egg to freeze within seconds.   More generally, the media are paying tribute to essential workers - including police officers, firefighters, soldiers and street cleaners - who are continuing to work outdoors during the cold.  China has seen record temperatures over the past year, for heat as well as cold.  Earlier this month, the Xinhua news agency said that the country had recorded the hottest summer and autumn in 60 years, with multiple cities breaking records.  Climate change increases the likelihood of extreme weather generally - and while scientists agree global temperatures are rising, that doesn't mean we will stop having periods of very cold weather.

They also said they were ""deeply touched"" by the ""outpouring of love and support"" they had received.  Mr Sands, 65, disappeared on 13 January while hiking in the Baldy Bowl area of the San Gabriel Mountains, north of Los Angeles.  Last week, his car was found next to where he was reported missing. In the statement - put out on the 11th day since Mr Sands went missing - the family praised the ""heroic search teams"" who are working through the difficult weather conditions ""on the ground and in the air to bring Julian home"". California has been battered by deadly storms, and the San Bernardino County Sheriff's department said it had responded to more than a dozen calls on Mount San Antonio, known locally as Mount Baldy, and in the surrounding area over the last four weeks. It warned hikers to ""stay away"" from that area. ""It is extremely dangerous and even experienced hikers are getting in trouble,"" the department said. Earlier in January, a mother of four whom friends described as an experienced hiker died after sliding more than 500ft (152m) down Mount Baldy. Last week, a spokesperson for the sheriff's department told the PA news agency that conditions were still too dangerous for ground crews to operate due to wintry weather, and that searches would be conducted by helicopter only. Born in Yorkshire, Mr Sands has appeared in dozens of films and TV shows, but it was a lead role in the 1985 British romance A Room With A View that brought him global fame. He lives in the North Hollywood neighbourhood of Los Angeles with his wife, writer Evgenia Citkowitz. They have two children. Mr Sands has talked in the past about his love of hiking and mountain climbing. When asked in 2020 what made him happy, he replied: ""Close to a mountain summit on a glorious cold morning.""

Some documents seized at the Wilmington property on Friday were from his time as a senator and others from his tenure as vice-president under Barack Obama. Lawyer Bob Bauer said ""personally handwritten notes"" and ""surrounding materials"" were also taken away. Mr Biden and his wife were not present. The president offered access ""to his home to allow DoJ to conduct a search of the entire premises for potential vice-presidential records and potential classified material"", Mr Bauer said in a statement on Saturday. Former President Donald Trump is facing a criminal investigation for allegedly mishandling classified files. Earlier this month Mr Biden's lawyers said a first batch of classified documents had been found on 2 November at the Penn Biden Center, a think-tank the president founded in Washington DC.  A second batch of records was found on 20 December in the garage at his Wilmington home, while another document was found in a storage space at the house on 12 January, his lawyers said.  After finding the documents, the president said his team immediately turned them over to the National Archives and the Justice Department. It is not clear why Mr Biden had kept them. Under the Presidential Records Act, White House records are supposed to go to the National Archives once an administration ends, where they can be stored securely. A special counsel, Robert Hur, has been appointed to lead the investigation into how the sensitive documents were handled. The lengthy search and subsequent discovery of more documents is a political headache for the president, as he prepares to declare whether he will run for a second term in 2024. Mr Biden and his wife, Jill, are spending the weekend in the coastal town of Rehoboth Beach in Delaware, where they own another house. It was searched earlier this month and no documents were found, his lawyers said, according to the New York Times. The two-month gap between the first Biden discovery - days before the midterm elections - and the news being made public in January raises awkward questions for the president about transparency, BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher says. Mr Biden's team insists the president has co-operated fully with the DoJ inquiry. Mr Biden has played down the affair as an oversight, saying he has ""no regrets"" about not publicly disclosing the discovery of some classified files before the November midterm elections. The discovery comes as former US President Donald Trump also faces a probe over his alleged mishandling of hundreds of classified documents at his Florida Mar-a-Lago residence and his alleged failure to comply with a subpoena.  Mr Trump and his lawyers resisted handing over the documents until the FBI raided his Florida holiday home last August. He alleges that President Biden is being treated more favourably by the FBI. President Biden said at the time that Mr Trump's handling of the documents was ""totally irresponsible"". Mr Trump has not given any reason to explain their presence there but has said he had the power as president to declassify them, a claim challenged by legal experts. Â© 2023 BBC.

The National Cyber Security Centre has issued a fresh alert about increasing attempts to steal information from specific groups and individuals.  NCSC said the hackers usually target those doing research and work about Iran and Russia. It described the hacking groups as ""ruthless"" in pursuing their targets. The NCSC - which is part of UK cyber and intelligence agency GCHQ and gives cyber-security advice - explained the attacks were not targeting the public, but specific individuals and groups, including politicians, officials, journalists, activists and think tanks.  The hackers will often impersonate real contacts to build trust, and send fake invites to events or Zoom meetings containing malicious code. If clicked on, they can compromise accounts allowing the hacker to gain access to sensitive information.  NCSC director of operations Paul Chichester said: ""These campaigns by threat actors based in Russia and Iran continue to ruthlessly pursue their targets in an attempt to steal online credentials and compromise potentially sensitive systems. ""We strongly encourage organisations and individuals to remain vigilant to potential approaches and follow the mitigation advice in the advisory to protect themselves online."" The number of individuals targeted in the UK is small - in the tens - with a minimal impact, officials say. But organisations have been asked to secure their online accounts, and report suspicious approaches.  Officials are not formally accusing Russia and Iran of involvement in the espionage, although two hacking groups they are warning about are widely believed to be linked to the two states. A Russian group, known as SEABORGIUM or Cold River, has previously been linked in media reports to the leaking of emails belonging to ex-MI6 head Sir Richard Dearlove and the targeting of US nuclear laboratories. Google has said the group has also targeted US think tanks, a Ukraine-based defence contractor and the military of multiple Eastern European countries.  An Iranian Group - known as TA453 or Charming Kitten - has been linked by independent cyber-security experts to the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and is accused of targeting US politicians as well as critical infrastructure. The campaigns are separate and not the result of collaboration, but the joint warning is being issued because they rely on similar techniques and targets.

It is the latest discovery in a growing controversy that has already embroiled both former President Donald Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden. Classified records are supposed to go to the National Archives once an administration leaves office. Here is a look at what is going on, with analysis from our senior political correspondent Anthony Zurcher on how serious an issue each man faces. What happened? A lawyer for the former vice-president discovered ""a small number of documents bearing classified markings"" at his personal residence in Carmel, Indiana, last week, according to a letter to the Archives. The material had been ""inadvertently"" stored in boxes that were not in a secure area, but were taped up and appeared to be unopened since they were packed, Mr Pence's attorney said.  How did they respond? According to the letter, neither the ex-vice-president nor his counsel reviewed the contents of the documents, but they were moved to a locked safe. In a second letter to the archives, attorney Greg Jacob wrote that FBI agents retrieved the papers from the safe on 19 January. He added that he would also personally deliver the two boxes in which the records had been found, and two more boxes containing copies of vice-presidential records, to the Archives on 23 January. How many records were found? There were about a dozen documents discovered last week, according to CNN, which cited multiple sources familiar with the matter. It is unclear yet if the four boxes voluntarily transferred to the Archives contain more classified materials. How bad is it? It's still too early to know exactly the extent of the trouble for the former vice-president, which could depend on how many documents were discovered and what types of classified information they contained. Given that he is considering his own presidential run in 2024, it is an unwanted distraction that will keep him from criticising Mr Trump and Mr Biden - potentially his top two White House rivals - on the topic. What happened?  A first batch of classified documents was discovered at the Penn Biden Center - an office space - in Washington DC in November last year just before the midterm elections. This was not made public at the time.  Later, in December, attorneys for Mr Biden found additional documents at his Delaware home. More documents were recovered during searches of Mr Biden's home on 11 and 12 January, as well as on 20 January.  How did they respond?  Attorneys for Mr Biden immediately alerted the office of the White House counsel after the initial batch of documents was discovered on 2 November, Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, said earlier in January. The files were handed over to the National Archives the following day.  The justice department was also immediately told about the other discoveries. The documents recovered on 20 January were found during an FBI search of the Delaware property, to which Mr Biden had voluntarily agreed.  Mr Biden has said his team did ""what they should have done"" and was ""co-operating fully and completely"" with the investigation.  How many records were found? The precise number of classified records uncovered from Mr Biden's home and former office remains unclear - but stands at at least a dozen from the January searches alone.  Mr Sauber has described the first November discovery as ""a small number"" of documents.  How bad is it? It's never a good thing when a special counsel is investigating a president, as these inquiries tend to take on a life of their own.   While Mr Biden has said he has been forthcoming about the location of the documents, delays in revealing their discovery and a steady stream of new revelations have made this a bigger problem than it at first appeared. What happened?  An 8 August 2022, an FBI search of Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida uncovered dozens of boxes and about 11,000 documents. This included approximately 100 with classification markings. The search warrant came after attorneys representing Mr Trump had said all government records were returned.  Earlier in January the National Archives found ""a lot"" of classified material in a set of 15 boxes it had received in January.  How did they respond?  Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and claimed that he had declassified the documents taken with him. In September, for example, he told Fox News that as president he had the ability to declassify documents ""even by thinking about it"".  He has also characterised the issue as part of a ""witch hunt"" against him. He has said that the search of his Mar-a-Lago estate was unwarranted and referred to it as ""dark times for our nation"".  How many records were found? To date, about 300 classified documents have been recovered from Mr Trump since his administration ended.  How bad is it? The challenge for Mr Trump is that the most serious allegations against him are not for possessing classified documents, but for stonewalling and obstructing the efforts by the National Archives and, later, the FBI to retrieve them.   The news about Joe Biden and Mike Pence, however, bolster the former president's claims that this is an infraction that many others have committed - and that he is being singled out for harsher treatment.

""A book has become a luxury item here in Egypt. It's not a basic commodity like food and people are saving on luxuries,"" says Mohammed El-Baaly of Sefsafa Publishing House. He was speaking as the Cairo International Book Fair, which last year attracted two million people, opens to the public. With book prices more than doubling, some Egyptian authors say they have cut back on characters and descriptions to be more economical in their writing. ""The cost of paper and ink has gone up tremendously,"" Mr El-Baaly says. ""The cost of a tonne of paper is now nearly four times higher than at the start of the year!"" He says he has turned to printing books overseas and is producing fewer copies, as he expects falling demand.   It was the fear of a drop in numbers of shoppers at this year's book fair - the oldest and largest of its kind in the Arab world and a major event for the publishing industry - which led to the idea of paying in instalments. The Egyptian Publishers Association says customers can now choose to take up to nine months to buy a book, paying 1.5% interest. Author Dina Afifi, who writes popular fiction for teens, is hoping the scheme will boost flagging sales. She says the appearance of her latest book about pharaohs was changed to lower the cost of production. ""My book's been downsized, slimmed down to just 60 pages from around 100, because of the rising printing costs,"" she told the BBC. Some Egyptian novelists have described ways they have stripped back their writing to produce shorter books - simplifying storylines by introducing fewer minor characters and limiting the amount of description. They complain that more Egyptian readers are now buying counterfeit copies of books of low quality. These are sold at stalls on the streets for prices ranging between 50 and 100 Egyptian pounds ($1.67-3.35; Â£1.36-2.70). In recent months, accelerating inflation has slashed the spending power of Egyptians who had already endured years of austerity and recurring economic shocks. Egypt - which relies heavily on foreign imports - has suffered from a currency crisis. After successive devaluations, money is worth half of what it was a year ago. The government says it is doing what it can to bring down prices and blames the strain on external factors linked to the war in Ukraine.   One Egyptian poet said it was unsurprising that this year, ordinary people were more worried about putting food on the table than buying books, which would nourish their minds. Â© 2023 BBC.

This happened after Delhi launched strikes against militants in Pakistani territory following an attack on Indian troops in Kashmir. Pakistan had then said it had shot down two Indian military jets and captured a fighter pilot. India and Pakistan claim all of Kashmir, but control only parts of it. India has long accused Pakistan of backing separatist militants in the Kashmir valley - a charge Islamabad denies. The nuclear-armed neighbours have fought three wars since independence from Britain and partition in 1947. All but one were over Kashmir. In Never Give An Inch: Fighting for the America I Love, Mr Pompeo says he does ""not think the world properly knows just how close the India-Pakistan rivalry came to spilling over into a nuclear conflagration in February 2019"". ""The truth is, I don't know precisely the answer either; I just know it was too close,"" he writes. Mr Pompeo says he will ""never forget the night"" he was in Hanoi at a summit ""negotiating with the North Koreans on nuclear weapons"" when ""India and Pakistan started threatening each other in connection with the decades-long dispute over the northern border region of Kashmir"". After the attack on Indian troops that killed more than 40 soldiers - ""an Islamist terrorist attack... probably enabled in part by Pakistan's lax counter-terror policies"", according to Mr Pompeo - India had responded with air strikes inside Pakistan. ""The Pakistanis shot down a plane in a subsequent dogfight and kept the Indian pilot prisoner."" Mr Pompeo said he was awakened in Hanoi to speak with an Indian ""counterpart"", who is unnamed. ""He believed the Pakistanis had begun to prepare their nuclear weapons for a strike. India, he informed me, was contemplating its own escalation,"" Mr Pompeo writes. ""I asked him to do nothing and give us a minute to sort things out."" Mr Pompeo writes he began to work with the then National Security Adviser John Bolton who was with him in the ""tiny secure communications facility in our hotel"". He says he reached out to Pakistan's then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, with ""whom I had engaged many times"", and told him what the ""Indians had told me"". ""He said it wasn't true. As one might expect, he believed the Indians were preparing their nuclear weapons for deployment. It took us a few hours - and remarkably good work by our teams on the ground in New Delhi and Islamabad - to convince each side that the other was not preparing for nuclear war. ""No other nation would have done what we did that night to avoid a horrible outcome,"" Mr Pompeo writes. Neither India nor Pakistan have commented so far on Mr Pompeo's claims.  The 2019 attack on Indian soldiers was claimed by a group based in Pakistan, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and India had vowed to retaliate.  India's aerial attacks across the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Indian and Pakistani territory were the first since a war in 1971. India said it had killed a large number of militants but Pakistan called the claim ""reckless"". Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Mr Bolsonaro has been staying in Florida since 30 December. The former president plans to stay in the US while immigration officials process the visa.  He is under investigation in Brazil after rioters stormed key government buildings early this month. Mr Bolsonaro has voiced ""regret"" for the unrest, but denies he caused it. The former president has ""devoted 34 years of his life to public service"" and would ""like to take some time off"", his lawyer, Felipe Alexandre told the BBC in a statement. Mr Bolsonaro initially travelled to the US on an A-1 visa for diplomats and heads of state, which expires after 30 days. He came to the US ahead of his leftist successor Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva's 1 January inauguration.  The former president hopes to ""clear his head and enjoy being a tourist in the United States for a few months before deciding what his next step will be"", said Mr Alexandre, who works for AG Immigration, an immigration law firm.  US immigration officials received Mr Bolsonaro's request for a B1/B2 tourism visa last Friday, he said.  On 8 January, thousands of the former president's supporters attacked federal buildings in BrasÃ­lia following his defeat in the 2022 general election.  Mr Bolsonaro has faced criticism for the riots where protestors, spurred by unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, broke past security and invaded Brazil's presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court.  The former right-wing leader - who has been nicknamed the ""Donald Trump of the Tropics"" because of his close ties to the former US president - has been staying at the Florida home of former mixed martial arts fighter JosÃ© Aldo.  His supporters have flocked to the house in the gated community in Kissimmee, Florida, a state where a fifth of Brazilians living in the US reside. Democratic lawmakers in Washington DC have taken issue with Mr Bolsonaro's stay in the US. In a letter sent earlier this month, dozens asked President Joe Biden to ""revoke"" any diplomatic visa Mr Bolsonaro might hold.  ""The United States must not provide shelter for him, or any authoritarian who has inspired such violence against democratic institutions,"" they wrote.  Mr Alexandre told the Financial Times on Monday that Mr Bolsonaro ""bears no responsibility"" for the riots.  Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Now BBC News has seen evidence of how the authorities are using dating and social apps to do this. All victims' names have been changed  Having grown up in Egypt, I am aware of the pervasive homophobia that permeates every part of its society. But friends there tell me that the atmosphere has recently become far more brutal, and the tactics for tracking down LGBT people more sophisticated.  There is no explicit law against homosexuality in Egypt, but our investigation has found that the crime of ""debauchery"" - a sex work law - is being used to criminalise the LGBT community. Transcripts submitted in police arrest reports show how officers are posing online to seek out - and in some cases allegedly fabricate evidence against - LGBT people looking for dates online. They reveal how the police initiate text conversations with their targets.  Egypt is one of the most strategically important Western allies in the Middle East and receives billions of dollars in US and EU support every year. Around half a million British tourists visit the country annually and the UK trains Egyptian police forces, via the UN.  In one text conversation between an undercover police officer and someone using the social networking and dating app WhosHere, the officer appears to be pressuring the app user to meet up in person - that person was later arrested.  Police: Have you slept with men before? App user: Yes  Police: How about we meet?  App user: But I live with mom and dad Police: Come on dear, don't be shy, we can meet in public and then go to my flat.  There are more examples which are too explicit to publish. It is extremely difficult for LGBT people to openly meet potential dates in public in Egypt, so dating apps are a popular way to do that. But just using the apps - regardless of your sexuality - can be grounds for arrest based on the incitement of debauchery or public morality laws in Egypt. It is not just Egyptians who are being targeted. In one transcript, police describe identifying a foreigner, who we are calling Matt, on the popular gay dating app Grindr. A police informant then engaged Matt in conversation, and - the transcript says - Matt ""admitted his perversion, his willingness to engage in debauchery for free, and sent pictures of himself and his body"". Matt told the BBC that he was subsequently arrested, charged with ""debauchery"", and eventually deported.  QUEER EGYPT UNDER ATTACK LGBTQ people hunted by gangs and police in Egypt. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)  Viewers outside the UK can watch now, on YouTube In some of the transcripts, the police appear to be trying to pressure people who seem to be simply seeking dates or new friendships into agreeing to sex for money. Legal experts in Egypt tell us that proving there has been an exchange of money, or an offer of one, can give the authorities the ammunition they need to take a case to court.   One such victim, whom we found through the transcripts, was a gay man we are calling Laith. In April 2018, the contemporary dancer was contacted from a friend's phone number. ""Hello, how are you?"" the message said. The ""friend"" asked to meet for a drink.  But when Laith arrived to meet him, his friend was nowhere in sight. He was met instead by police who arrested him and threw him into a cell belonging to the vice squad.  One policeman stubbed a cigarette out on his arm, he told me, showing me the scar. ""It was the only time in my life that I tried to kill myself,"" Laith says. He claims police then made a fake profile for him on the WhosHere app, and digitally altered his photos to make them look explicit. He says they then mocked up a conversation on the app which appeared to show him offering sex work. He says the pictures are proof that he was framed, because the legs in the picture do not resemble his own - one of his legs is bigger than the other. The BBC has only had access to grainy photocopied police case files, so it cannot independently verify this detail.  Three other people told us the police forced or falsified confessions related to their cases, too. Laith was jailed for three months for ""habitual debauchery"", reduced to a month on appeal. Laith says the police also tried to get him to inform on other gay people he knew of. For the BBC documentary Queer Egypt Under Attack we used innovative face-tracking 3-D masking to ensure identities remained protected - the aim was to give the film a more attractive aesthetic than the usual blobbing technique of disguise allows.   ""[The policeman] said: 'I can fabricate a whole story about you if you don't give me names.'""  The Egyptian government has spoken publicly about its use of online surveillance to target what it described as ""homosexual gatherings"". In 2020, Ahmed Taher, former assistant to the Minister of Interior for Internet Crimes and Human Trafficking, told the newspaper Ahl Masr: ""We recruited police in the virtual world to uncover the masses of group sex parties, homosexual gatherings.""  The UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office told the BBC that no UK funding has gone towards training for the Egyptian police in activities relevant to the claims made in the investigation. UK MP Alicia Kearns, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told the BBC that she wanted more to be done to warn LGBT travellers about the risks in countries such as Egypt, ""where their sexuality might be weaponised against them"". ""I would urge the Egyptian government to cease all activities which target individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation."" The Egyptian government did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. The WhosHere app was referenced in nearly every police transcript the BBC has had access to.  Cyber privacy experts told us that WhosHere seems to have specific vulnerabilities, allowing hackers to scrape information about its users - such as location - on a large scale.  And they say the way WhosHere is collecting and storing data is likely in breach of privacy laws in the UK and the EU. It was only after the BBC formally approached WhosHere that the app changed its settings, removing the ""seeking same sex"" selection, which could put people at risk of identification. WhosHere disputes the BBC's findings about vulnerabilities and say that they have a robust history of addressing problems when raised. And that they do not operate any specific service for the LGBT community in Egypt.  Grindr, also used as an app by police and criminals to find LGBT people in Egypt said: ""We work extensively with Egyptian LGBTQ activists, international human rights advocates, and safety-focused technologists to best serve our users in the region.""  Criminal gangs are using the same tactics as the police to find LGBT people. They then attack and humiliate them, and extort them by threatening to post the videos online. I managed to track down two people we are calling Laila and Jamal, who were victims of a video that went viral in Egypt a few years ago. The footage shows them being forced to strip and dance, while being beaten and abused. They are forced at knife point to give their full names and admit they are gay. They told me the duo behind the video - named Bakar and Yahia - are notorious amongst the community.  We saw at least four videos in which Bakar and Yahia either appeared, or could be heard, extorting and abusing LGBT people before they uploaded the videos to Whatsapp, YouTube and Facebook. In one of these videos, an 18-year-old gay man we are calling Saeed is forced to, falsely, say he is a sex worker. I met him to hear about what happened next. He told me that he considered legal action but says his lawyer advised against this, telling him his sexuality would be perceived as more of a crime than the attack he suffered. Saeed is now alienated from his family. He says they cut him off when the gang sent them the video in a bid to blackmail them too. ""I have been suffering from depression after what happened, with the videos circulating to all my friends in Egypt. I don't go out, and I don't have a phone. ""No-one used to know anything about me."" We've been told about dozens of attacks like this - carried out by multiple gangs. There are only a few reports of attackers being arrested.  It shocked me to learn, in the course of investigation that one gang leader, Yahia, is gay and actively posting online about his own sex work. But perhaps it gives him a criminal edge - he knows just how vulnerable his targets are. And arguably his own position, as a gay man with little opportunity, fuels his criminality.  We have no evidence that Yahia has been involved in recent attacks, and he has denied  involvement in any of the attacks. Covering any of these issues inside Egypt itself has been banned since 2017, when the country's Supreme Council for Media Regulation imposed a media blackout on LGBT representation except if the coverage ""acknowledge[s] the fact that their conduct is inappropriate"". LGBT community advocates, many of them in exile, are divided over whether the problems in Egypt should be highlighted in the media or tackled behind the scenes. But Laila, Saeed, Jamal and Laith have chosen to step out of the shadows and break the silence.  Additional reporting by: Vanessa Bowles, Bettina Waked and Jasmine Bonshor Â© 2023 BBC.

Supporters of Dhirendra Krishna Shastri, popularly known as Bageshwar Dham Sarkar, claim that he has divine powers and that he can heal the sick, cure people possessed by ghosts and help people tide over business and financial problems.  The 26-year-old chief priest of the Bageshwar Dham temple, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, dresses in colourful clothes, sports hats similar to those worn by 18th-Century Peshwa rulers of Maharashtra, and counts powerful government ministers and politicians among his followers. He has become a TV and social media sensation. In recent weeks, India's Hindi-language news channels have devoted hundreds of hours to the guru and his professed powers. And his utterances on controversial topics such as religious conversions and inter-faith marriages are now being reported as ""breaking news"". His social media following has risen rapidly to reach 7.5 million - with 3.4 million followers on Facebook, 3.9 million YouTube subscribers, 300,000 followers on Instagram and 72,000 on Twitter. Some of his most popular videos have been watched between three and 10 million times. Mr Shastri burst into the national limelight in January, after a well-known rationalist questioned his claims that he had healing powers and could read people's minds. Shyam Manav, who runs an anti-superstition movement through his organisation Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti, offered to pay 3m rupees ($36,500; Â£30,000) if Mr Shastri correctly read the minds of 10 people chosen by him. The challenge was made when Mr Shastri was holding a camp in the city of Nagpur in Maharashtra - the state where Mr Manav is based.  When Mr Shastri left the city without taking the challenge, some said he'd run away. Since then, he's given a number of TV interviews where he's denied running away and said that he was willing to take the challenge, but not in Maharashtra. Instead, he proposed the neighbouring state of Chhattisgarh, a ""neutral"" venue. But Mr Manav says that since he made the claims about his superpowers in Maharashtra, he must prove them there. Since the controversy began, reports say Mr Manav has received death threats and police have tightened his security. A few days ago, Mr Shastri also filed a complaint with the police saying that he too had received a death threat over the phone. The controversy and the breathless media coverage - with one mainstream reporter kneeling at his feet and promoting his claims of healing the sick and ability to read people's minds - have only added to his popularity. In YouTube videos put out by the Bageshwar Dham temple, he is seen addressing large gatherings attended by thousands of people. At one rally he claims that ""there are 400,000 people in attendance"".  On stage and the TV screen he is often very animated - punctuating his sentences with claps, he giggles as if laughing at some private joke. At times he bobs up and down on his seat, points a finger at the camera, mutters to himself and speaks in different voices. At one gathering, he summons ""a man called Mukesh, who is dressed in a vest and is not wearing a shirt"" from the crowd. When such a man appears on the stage, he writes down on a sheet of paper what ails Mukesh and his family without talking to him. Mukesh readily agrees when he hears his troubles read out from this sheet. At another event, he writes down some mantras for a mother whose child suffers from seizures. ""Recite them daily, these will help your son and also take care of your financial hardship,"" he tells her. Such performances have helped Mr Shastri gain a reputation as a ""miracle worker"", with his supporters claiming that ""he has a third eye, and can peep inside your heart, mind and soul"".  But critics accuse him of practising witchcraft and spreading superstition and doing cheap tricks to impress the gullible masses.  Magicians and mentalists (mind-readers) have come forwards in the past few days to demonstrate that they can pull off similar feats too, saying that it's just an art and not some divine gift.  ""What he's doing is mentalism. You cannot call it a miracle. It's an art form, a skill that's learnt. If anyone tells you that it's a miracle, then he's spreading superstition, he's spreading lies,"" Suhani Shah, a mentalist, told a news channel.  Mr Shastri has said he is ""being falsely accused of promoting superstition"" and that he hasn't claimed he can solve ""every problem"". Even some prominent Hindu religious leaders have questioned his prowess - one of them said that if Mr Shastri is really able to perform miracles, then he must repair the houses which have developed cracks in the sinking Himalayan town of Joshimath.  Mr Shastri has also been embroiled in political controversies over what appear to be anti-minority statements and calling for India to be made a Hindu rashtra (nation). He was also accused of practising untouchability last year, after a video went viral that showed him telling a man ""don't touch me... you're untouchable"". But he has significant support among many right-wing Hindu leaders, who say he is being picked on for opposing religious conversion of Hindus.  ""If anyone speaks against religious conversionâ¦ [they] will be falsely accused and attacked. This is the reason behind the attacks against Bageshwar Maharaj. That's why we're with him,"" Kapil Mishra, a leader of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, tweeted recently. Mr Shastri often describes himself as a ""country bumpkin"" and ""an illiterate man"" and, according to the temple's official website, he was interested in religion from early childhood and often bunked off school to visit it. Born in 1996 in a poor Brahmin family in Chhatarpur district's Gada village, he dropped out after a few years of education to work to supplement the family income.  One of his schoolmates told BBC Hindi that a few years ago, Mr Shastri disappeared for a year. It was after his return that politicians and other influential people started visiting the temple to meet him. ""Until five years ago, he used to travel on motorbikes,"" he said.  Today, he travels in a convoy of a dozen cars and flies around, sometimes by private jets, in India and abroad. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Here's a look at the most memorable outfits worn on the red carpet before the ceremony. Roses are red, violets are blue, Lizzo won a Grammy and performed on stage too. The US singer paid homage to a late, great compatriot while collecting her record of the year award. ""When we lost Prince I decided to dedicate my life to making positive music,"" she said onstage. Taylor Swift sparkled on arrival wearing a sequinned blue gown, while also showing off her midriff. The star picked up four nominations ahead of this year's event, including song of the year for the expanded, re-recorded version of All Too Well, but missed out on the award once again.  Harry Styles had his inkwork on display as he arrived in stylish patterned dungarees. The northern Englishman took home the night's big prize for best album for Harry's House. ""This doesn't happen to people like me very often, and this is so nice,"" he said onstage. Styles graced the Grammys performance stage on Sunday night, as did R 'n' B icon Mary J Blige, who was also nominated for several big awards. Sam Smith and their colour-coordinated entourage, including Unholy collaborator Kim Petras, turned heads ahead of the main ceremony - where they put on a firey musical display. Rap stars Cardi B and Offset stepped out in their finest glad rags. Brandi Carlile was up for many of the night's biggest honours, including album and record of the year. Collecting an early award for best rock performance, the suited and booted singer-songwriter noted how she had succeeded by rejecting her mother's advice. ""Mom, I gotta thank you for telling me to stop singing so angry, because I obviously ignored that like I ignored everything you ever told me to do,"" she said with a smile.  ""But I cut my hair, I learned how to scream, and I just won a Grammy for a rock and roll song that I wrote with all my heart."" Bebe Rexha was nominated for best dance/electronic recording for her David Guetta collaboration I'm Good (Blue). Despite that, she wore this pink, plunging gown on the red carpet. It was all white on the night for Shaggy, who was nominated for best reggae album for Com Fly Wid Mi - a collection of Sting-produced Frank Sinatra covers. Leather-clad Doja Cat was nominated for a handful of awards including record of the year for Woman. Singer and songwriter Anitta said she was ""making history"" as the first Brazilian artist to be nominated for best new artist at the Grammys in nearly half a century. Speaking to journalists on the red carpet, she said: ""My whole country is watching and Brazil is waiting for this. For me, the victory is to be here tonight, to be honest."" Elvis Costello's album The Boy Named If was nominated for best rock album and, like all self-respecting rock stars, he wore sunglasses indoors. Mick Fleetwood's outfit was accessorised with a pair of dangling metallic balls - a nod to the cover of his band's classic album Rumours. He was there to pay tribute to his late bandmate Christine McVie. Five-time Grammy winner Shania Twain's hair matched the red carpet at she arrived in a ""fun"" polka dot suit and towering hat by British-American fashion designer Harris Reed. Twain collected the award for best country album on behalf of winner Willie Nelson. ""I am here to represent country music and I am excited,"" she said beforehand. Rap legend LL Cool J introduced a special 12-minute musical segment marking the 50th anniversary of hip-hop. ""It feels like yesterday I was just a little kid in the basement listening to Cold Crush tapes and now here we are all these years later on, on the biggest stage in the world in hundreds of countries around the world, presenting hip-hop the way I think it should be seen by the masses,"" he reflected before the show. Adding: ""For a long time hip-hop has been served in a brown greasy paper bag but tonight we're going to serve it on a silver platter, so it feels good."" Pharrell Williams looked happy to be there, rocking up in a fur coat over the top of a matching red jacket and trousers combo. Italian Eurovision winners Maneskin looked sharp but missed out on the best new artist award, which ultimately went to Samara Joy. The same can be said for DJ Khaled, who was nominated for song of the year for his track God Did, losing out to Bonnie Raitt. Though he did get to perform the track on stage alongside collaborators Jay-Z, John Legend and Lil Wayne. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

The 27-year-old's guilty plea in a Canberra court came after his lawyers failed to have the charge dismissed on mental health grounds. Mr Kyrgios pushed Chiara Passari onto the pavement during a row in Canberra in 2021, the court heard. The magistrate called the incident ""a single act of stupidity or frustration"" when sparing him a criminal record. Mr Kyrgios released a statement after the ruling saying he was grateful to the court for dismissing the charges without conviction. ""I was not in good place when this happened and I reacted to a difficult situation in a  way I deeply regret,"" he said. ""I know it wasn't OK and I'm sincerely sorry for the hurt I caused."" Agreed facts tendered to the court say Mr Kyrgios pushed Ms Passari after she stopped his car from driving away while they were arguing on 10 January 2021. Ms Passari reported the incident to police the next month but did not make a formal complaint. The couple reconciled and resumed a relationship, but after they broke up, Ms Passari made a formal complaint in December 2021. Mr Kyrgios' lawyer argued his client had been trying to de-escalate the fight by calling an Uber, and had repeatedly tried to ""lawfully"" move Ms Passari away from the car. ""It is in that context and the frustration that resulted, that my client reacted and the offence occurred,"" Michael Kukulies-Smith said. The court heard Mr Kyrgios had sworn at Ms Passari and told her to go away. He then put his hands on her hips and moved her an arms length from the door, but Ms Passari stepped back. The tennis star then said: ""I'm serious. I'm going toâ¦"" before pushing Ms Passari in the shoulder, causing her to fall. Ms Passari felt some pain and later noticed grazing on her knee, the court heard. The court heard Mr Kyrgios apologised the next day - an act that showed he accepted responsibility for his actions, his lawyer said. Mr Kukulies-Smith also told the court on Friday there was: ""a relationship between the mental health and the offending - even though he no longer suffers it to the same extent today."" Mr Kyrgios' psychologist Sam Borenstein told the court the tennis player's mental illness was ""recurrent"" and he had suffered from thoughts of self harm - but his condition had been improving.  When sentencing Mr Kygrios, Magistrate Beth Campbell said he had been ""a young man trying to extricate himself from a heighted emotional situation"".  ""You acted in the heat of the moment,"" she said. ""I am dealing with you in the same way I would deal with any young man in this court. You are a young man who happens to hit a tennis ball particularly well."" She told Mr Kyrgios that references from family showed he had a lot of ""love and support"" around him.  The tennis player arrived at court on Friday on crutches following recent knee surgery. An injury forced him to withdraw from the Australian Open last month. Â© 2023 BBC.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced the decision to send 14 tanks - and allow other countries to send theirs too - at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. US President Joe Biden's administration is also expected to announce plans to send at least 30 M1 Abrams tanks.  A Kremlin spokesman earlier said the tanks would ""burn like all the rest"". Dmitry Peskov said there was an overestimation of the potential the tanks would bring to the Ukrainian army, and called the move a ""failed plan"". But Ukrainian officials insist they are urgently in need of heavier weapons, and say sufficient battle tanks could help Kyiv's forces seize back territory from the Russians.  A German government spokesperson said the decision to supply the tanks ""follows our well-known line of supporting Ukraine to the best of our ability"". Germany also permitted other countries to send their Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine - which was restricted until now under export regulations.  The US and Germany had resisted internal and external pressure to send their tanks to Ukraine for some time. Washington cited the extensive training and maintenance required for the high-tech Abrams. Germans endured months of political debate about concerns that sending tanks would escalate the conflict and make Nato a direct party to the war with Russia. US media is reporting that an announcement regarding Abrams shipments to Ukraine could come as soon as Wednesday, with unnamed officials cited as saying at least 30 could be sent.  However the timing remains unclear, and it could take many months for the US combat vehicles to reach the battlefront.  German officials had reportedly been insisting they would only agree to the transfer of Leopard 2s to Ukraine if the US also sent M1 Abrams.  ""If the Germans continue to say we will only send or release Leopards on the conditions that Americans send Abrams, we should send Abrams,"" Democratic Senator Chris Coons, a Biden ally, told Politico on Tuesday.  Britain has already said it will send Challenger Two tanks to Ukraine.  Ukraine is still unlikely to get the 300 modern main battle tanks it says it needs to win the war. But if half a dozen Western nations each provide 14 tanks, then that would bring the total to nearly 100 - which could make a difference.  Western tanks - including the UK's Challenger 2, Germany's Leopard 2 and the US-made Abrams - are all seen as superior to their Soviet-era counterparts, like the ubiquitous T-72.  They will provide Ukrainian crews with more protection, speed and accuracy.  But Western modern main battle tanks are not a wonder weapon or game-changer on their own. It's also what's being supplied alongside them.  In recent weeks, there's been a step change in heavy weapons being supplied by the West - including hundreds more armoured vehicles, artillery systems and ammunition.  Combined together, they are the kind of military hardware needed to punch through Russian lines and to retake territory.  If Ukrainian troops can be trained and the weapons delivered in time, they could form key elements of any spring offensive. A missing element for offensive operations is still air power.  Ukraine has been asking for the West to provide modern fighter jets since the war began. So far, none has been delivered.   Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann of the liberal FDP party, who chairs the defence committee of the German parliament had previously described reports that Germany had approved the tanks as a relief to ""the battered and brave Ukrainian people.""  ""The decision was tough, it took far too long, but in the end it was unavoidable,"" she said. This video can not be played Watch: Poland's PM: ""Free world cannot afford not to send Leopard tanks"" Allied nations had become frustrated at what they perceived as German reluctance to send the armoured vehicles in recent days. The Ukrainian president's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, on Tuesday called on Western countries to give Kyiv hundreds of tanks to form a ""crushing fist"" against Russia. ""Tanks are one of the components for Ukraine to return to its 1991 borders,"" he wrote on Telegram. Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to Washington, wrote on Telegram: ""If the United States decides to supply tanks, then justifying such a step with arguments about 'defensive weapons' will definitely not work.  ""This would be another blatant provocation against the Russian Federation."" Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

John de Ruiter, 63, has led the College of Integrated Philosophy in Edmonton for decades, skirting controversy and accusations that he is running a cult.  A representative for Mr de Ruiter told the BBC in a statement that he will fight the charges in court. He will return to work at the College this week, the group's website said. Police in Edmonton, Alberta said they arrested Mr de Ruiter - who they describe as a ""self-appointed spiritual leader"" - and charged him with sexually assaulting four women in different incidents between 2012 and 2020.  According to reports to police, Mr de Ruiter told certain female members of his group that he ""was directed by a spirit to engage in sexual activity with them, and that engaging in sexual activity with him will provide them an opportunity to achieve a state of higher being or spiritual enlightenment"".  Police believe there may be more victims and have asked them to come forward.  Zaba Walker, a spokeswoman for Mr de Ruiter, said in an email to the BBC that he would be represented by legal counsel ""and intends to vigorously contest these charges in a court of law"".  ""This situation is deeply impactful for those who know Mr de Ruiter,"" she said.  According to the group's website, events planned with Mr de Ruiter beginning this weekend, including in-person gatherings in St Albert and Edmonton, will go ahead as scheduled. Mr de Ruiter, whose full first name is Johannes, was raised in rural Alberta and worked as a shoemaker and a junior pastor before developing his own teachings. He has described himself as the ""living embodiment of truth"", urging his thousands of devoted followers to understand life's meaning through ""core-splitting honesty"". The head of the College, Mr de Ruiter is not trained or certified as a psychologist or therapist.  He became known for weekly meetings in which he would stare silently at his followers for long periods of time. The precise number of his followers - some of whom have moved internationally to join his community - is unclear.  In 2017, an investigation by The Globe and Mail newspaper included interviews with several of Mr de Ruiter's followers who questioned his sexual relationship with some of his female devotees. According to the Globe, Mr de Ruiter's son, Nicolas, posted online about his father's sexual relationships with married women in his community. Mr de Ruiter told his son he had a ""knowing"" that he was meant to ""be with a number of women in sexual relations with a purpose of meaning"" the Globe reported.  On Mr de Ruiter's website, a frequently asked questions page includes a ""controversy"" section.  ""There are some extreme criticisms of John de Ruiter, are they true?"" one question asks.

The bird's death occurred just over a week after the mysterious disappearance of a clouded leopard that escaped from its exhibit through a cut-out hole.  Police have been asked to look into the death of the rare lappet-faced bird - one of 6,500 on the planet. Results from a necropsy report deemed the death ""very suspicious"".  ""The death does not appear to be from natural causes,"" zoo officials said in a statement. No further details where given due to the ongoing investigation. ""If it's related to anything that happened to the clouded leopard before, it goes from being about malicious and gets really into criminal intent,"" the zoo's president Greg Hudson said at a press conference. ""That is dangerous, and we're extremely concerned about it.""  It was the third suspicious incident at the zoo in less than two weeks. A three-year-old clouded leopard escaped from her enclosure on 13 January, prompting a ""code blue"" alert indicating that a non-dangerous animal was on the loose. Zoo staff members also found deliberate cuts on the enclosure that houses langur monkeys. A spokesperson for the Dallas Police Department said the US Fish and Wildlife Service had been called to assist with the investigation into the vulture's death. The zoo has recently ramped up its security efforts across the 110-acre campus, Mr Hudson said, including doubling the number of overnight security guards and adding to the 100-plus cameras already on zoo grounds. It is also offering a $10,000 (Â£8,122) reward for information leading to an arrest and indictment, according to a statement from the zoo. The lappet-faced vulture, named Pin, was 35 years old and had been at the Dallas Zoo for 32 years, during which time he sired 11 offspring and one grandchild.  ""A lot of people knew him very well having worked with him for so long,"" said Harrison Edell, vice president for animal care and conservation at the Dallas Zoo.  The bird was one of only 27 lappet-faced vultures in US zoos, and the species could move to critically endangered in our lifetime, he added. There only about 6,500 of the birds left globally, 41 in zoos outside of the US.  ""We're really disturbed by the idea that someone might have intentionally done this,"" Mr Edell said.  Â© 2023 BBC.

There is a well-deserved excitement about the return after six years of political rallies in Tanzania. Unbanned last month by President Samia Suluhu Hassan - Mr Magufuli's successor, it has even prompted the return of opposition politician Tundu Lissu, who had fled the country after surviving an assassination attempt. He was able to address his ecstatic supporters at a massive rally in Dar es Salaam last week within hours of landing. Such gatherings are the engine of politics here: the convoy of motorcycle taxis disrupting traffic and businesses on main roads, supporters chanting party songs and later the blaring of loudspeakers as politicians address the crowd. They really give life to local politics. As Dan Paget, a University of Aberdeen political lecturer with a focus on Tanzania, has said, they are the country's real form of mass communication. ""Indefinitely banning rallies does to public communication in Tanzania what indefinitely banning television, or the internet, would do in the global north,"" he wrote. They were the way the late president spoke to the country - especially after coming to office in 2015. He roamed freely on the road, making endless stops at villages and towns where he embarrassed and fired unpopular local officials and announced off-script policies.  He wanted the world to believe that he was the hardest-working president the country had ever had. Yet at the same time he forbade the opposition from exercising their constitutional right to assembly - his administration harassed and even arrested rival politicians when they held internal party meetings. Magufuli made us believe that he did this to defend his ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, saying the opposition were puppets of foreign interests. But the opposition actually posed no real existential threat. Magufuli just loved power, never missing an opportunity to bully those who did not agree with him - and seemed to delight in the suffering of his opponents.  Banning the rallies effectively cut off the opposition's political lifeblood. It must have given him ultimate satisfaction. Many analysts agree that the return of rallies comes down to efforts made by the new president, who has been in negotiations with the opposition Chadema party for a while.  She summed up her mission in a surprise op-ed printed in Tanzanian newspapers last year to mark the country's 30 years of multiparty politics. It was, President Samia wrote, to fulfil the four Rs: reconciliation, resiliency, reforms and rebuilding. Her critics may argue that this is easy to achieve given she has taken over from someone with such a poor record on democracy - also pointing out that she served as Magufuli's deputy for nearly six years. Yet since taking over in March 2021, President Samia has demonstrated that she does seem to genuinely care about fixing a broken system. She was under no real pressure to change. In the early days of her presidency, almost any policy change she made or a new direction her administration took was met with dismissive conclusions that she was being controlled by different factions of the CCM. The legacy of Magufuli's misogynist leadership style certainly made it difficult for a woman to flex her muscles in what is still a conservative, patriarchal society. So it has been good to see her handle male egos as she has subtly ushered in change and won battles against her critics such as the parliamentary speaker, who resigned last year. She has surprised the doubters who underestimated her charm. In fact such is the respect in which she is now held, a new word has been created for the praise and flattery the president now receives - ""chawacracy"", meaning shoe-licking. And ultimately President Samia has emerged as an winner of this latest reform.  It is an admission that many Tanzanians, especially those who do not support the ruling party, do not want to say out loud - but it is only fair to give her the credit she deserves. Even Chadema leader Freeman Mbowe recently praised her at his party's first rally on the shores of Lake Victoria: ""I don't have a problem congratulating the chairperson of the ruling party CCM when she saw the need [for reconciliation], accepted it and told me: 'Honourable Mbowe, let's move forward.'"" To please the CCM she could have continued with the status quo, but she gambled - and it seems to be paying off.  Interestingly she did it with a sleight of hand - it required no legal reforms, but it also means there is no guarantee that it cannot be reversed. And the 63-year-old has also demonstrated her control. She is the one who issues the outcomes of the negotiations with the opposition in a manner and at times that suit her the most. Even the setting of the announcement allowing rallies was telling - it was not a joint press conference in a neutral setting alongside Chadema on an equal footing. Instead it was at state house, pretty much reminding everyone who was in charge - with many smaller, and some would argue insignificant, opposition parties also present. This new era for the opposition poses daunting challenges. Seven years of effective dictatorship has left many people apathetic about politics here. Plus their sources of funding have been systematically and significantly crippled. Opposition parties have only a year to travel around a massive country before important local elections next year, with general elections following in 2025. Both will serve as litmus test as to how effective rallies can really be. Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica Â© 2023 BBC.

The bigger-than-expected growth helped drive new optimism about the company, which has been under pressure as its costs rise and advertising sales slump. Shares in parent company Meta surged more than 15% in after-hours trade as boss Mark Zuckerberg declared 2023 the ""year of efficiency"". He said he was focused on cost cuts. ""We're in a different environment now,"" he said, pointing to the firm's revenue, which declined in 2022 for the first time in its history after years of double-digit growth.  ""We don't anticipate that that's going to continue, but I also don't think it's going to go back to the way it was before."" Meta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, announced a major restructuring last year, including reducing office space and cutting 11,000 jobs or about 13% of staff.  The firm said those moves cost it $4.6bn last year - hitting its profits, which were almost cut in half. It still brought it in $23.2bn in profit for the year. ""2022 was a challenging year but I think we ended it having made good progress,"" Mr Zuckerberg said.  In the three months to December, the firm said revenue was $32.2bn, down 4% year-on-year.  But that was better than many analysts had expected.  Meta had alarmed investors last year when it posted the first-ever decline in daily Facebook users in its history and signalled it was focusing investments on virtual reality, known as the metaverse.  But in December, the number of users on the site daily was up 4% from a year earlier, adding users even in Europe and the US and Canada.   Meta said the number of people active across all of its apps each day was up 5% year-on-year.  Mr Zuckerberg said the company was making progress with its video product - Reels - which it has been focused on as it faces off with rivals such as TikTok, which have gained traction, especially among younger users.  Mr Zuckerberg said those efforts were starting to pay off, and ad dollars were starting to follow users to the videos.  Investors seized on the company's forecast of lower costs and stronger sales than expected in the months ahead, helping send shares higher.  The company also said it would spend an extra $40bn to buy back shares, which dropped sharply last year amid investor doubts about the direction of the company. Â© 2023 BBC.

The sculpture of the head of the Wedgwood pottery founder in Stoke-on-Trent was first unveiled in 1986. Stoke-on-Trent City Council apologised unreservedly and said it had been removed by contractors during a road widening project. Council leader Abi Brown said she was ""devastated"" the mistake had occurred. A council spokesperson said they had launched an investigation into the error and were speaking with contractors to understand what had gone wrong. The Josiah Wedgwood art installation, carved out of red bricks, was created by sculptor Vincent Woropay for the National Garden Festival in 1986. It moved to its current location at Festival Park in 2009. Road widening measures had recently begun on Marina Way to open up access to the park, where the sculpture stood, as part of changes following major infrastructure works and the opening of the Etruria Valley Link Road in January. Local historian Fred Hughes, who attended the first unveiling of the sculpture, said it was ""beyond belief"" that it had been removed. He said the remaining bricks of the sculpture should have been stored correctly so the sculpture could be reassembled elsewhere.  ""As far as I'm concerned, it's a scandal and I want to see it repaired,"" he said. The bricks and the base of the sculpture will now be sensitively removed from the park, the council had added. ""Culture is at the fabric of our city and plays a hugely significant role in the story of Stoke-on-Trent,"" Ms Brown said. ""I have instructed the director of the service to personally oversee immediate work to protect the sculpture and investigate how this has happened.""

The second-round runoff between former Prime Minister Andrej Babis and retired Nato general Petr Pavel is portrayed as a contest between populist oligarchy and liberal democracy. Mr Pavel appears to have a commanding lead over Mr Babis. The contest has been marked by disinformation and even death threats. In the Czech Republic, the role of president is a mostly ceremonial but still highly influential post. Mr Pavel and Mr Babis came top out of the seven men and one woman who were in the first round to replace Mr Zeman. Now, two weeks of increasingly ill-tempered and at times surreal campaigning now come to an end.  Mr Pavel went on social media this week to deny rumours of his own death which spread via email. A copy of his website also appeared to announce his death from heart failure. Mr Pavel said the matter was in the hands of the police. The disinformation was condemned by Mr Babis, who described the emails as ""disgusting"" and said he hoped the police would investigate thoroughly. Meanwhile, Mr Babis announced earlier this week that he would cancel all remaining in-person campaign appearances over fears for his personal safety after receiving an anonymous death threat. Gen Pavel remains the favourite despite revelations that he had received training in military intelligence during the communist era. A final rally in his support brought thousands to Prague's Old Town Square, where Mr Pavel told the crowd:  ""When I served in the Army, I served the country and all in it regardless of political preferences, and I wish to serve like that as president."" Mr Pavel's platform includes keeping the Czech Republic strongly anchored in the European Union and Nato and he has come out strongly in favour of further military aid for Ukraine against Russia's invasion. He also backs the adoption of the euro and progressive policies such as gay marriage. Meanwhile, during his time as prime minister, billionaire Mr Babis enjoyed close ties with Hungary's Viktor Orban, who continues to clash with the EU over the rule of law.  He has played on fears the war in Ukraine could spread to central Europe and said he would offer to mediate peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. The outcome of the election will be announced on Saturday afternoon. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "
104,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,Nigeria cost-of-living crisis sparks exodus of doctors,A cost-of-living crisis in Nigeria is forcing thousands of young professionals to flee abroad.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64417130,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1B15/production/_128433960_drkunleibisola-2.jpg,2023-01-30T05:33:57Z,"Africa's largest economy, Nigeria, is in the process of introducing new banknotes for the first time in more than 20 years. The move is an attempt to reignite confidence in the currency, the naira, which is under severe pressure. With inflation at more than 20%, people are struggling to cope with the rising cost of living. It is leading to the largest exodus of young professionals in years. ""Imagine going to the grocery store one day, and everything has tripled in price? How do you even cope? You have a family at home. What do you cut out of the budget?"" Oroma Cookey Gam tells me by Zoom, her face incredulous.  The fashion designer left Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, with her young family a year ago for the UK capital, London. Her husband and business partner Osione, an artist, was granted a Global Talent visa, which enables leaders in academia, arts and culture, as well as digital technology to work in the UK.  She says it had become too expensive to raise their young family in Lagos. ""Our money was buying us less and less. We weren't able to pay our bills, we weren't able to do normal things that we were doing."" Oroma studied law at the UK's University of Northumbria and moved back to Nigeria almost 20 years ago, keen to use her degree to help develop her country. Along with Osione, she eventually set up This Is Us, a sustainable fashion and lifestyle brand that uses local materials and artisans, including cotton grown and dyed in northern Nigeria.  Initially, the cost of living crisis wasn't impacting them. ""Because we are 100% sourced in Nigeria, things were not as terrible for us as it was for other people,"" Oroma says. ""So when everyone was increasing their prices, we skipped a couple of increases because we could manage.""  But eventually their Nigerian customer base was finding it harder to afford non-essential items like clothing - particularly when food accounts for 63% of their spending. This means when the price of food goes up, people have less disposable income.  Oroma says it is particularly bad for young Nigerians. ""Speaking to my mum, one thing that I realised is that when they were younger, things were a lot easier for them. They could afford to buy houses, cars.  ""I always felt like: 'What is going on with me?' I'm failing because I can't do all the things my mum was doing, but I realised that the country is not working for me."" She is not the only one to feel this way. Nigeria is experiencing its worst wave of emigration in years. Reliable statistics are hard to find, but the number of Nigerians granted UK work visas has quadrupled since 2019. And 700% more visas have been awarded to Nigerian students. There are long queues outside immigration processing centres and embassies every day, and everyone here seems to know someone who's leaving or trying to relocate abroad.  The term ""japa"", which means ""to run, flee or escape"" in Yoruba, has become a popular topic of conversation online, as well as on radio and TV chat shows.  Most of those who can afford to leave the country legally are well educated. They include doctors, nurses, engineers and IT professionals. It's led some to call the exodus a ""brain drain"".  The Nigeria Medical Association, says at least 50 doctors leave Nigeria every week to work abroad. Poor working conditions, coupled with bad pay and the rising cost of living are the main factors.  Kunle Ibisola is a junior doctor who used to work at the University College Hospital (UCH), in the south-western city of Ibadan. He now works for NHS Scotland.  ""My story is the story of most Nigerian doctors,"" he tells me over the phone. ""I never wanted to leave Nigeria. My intention was to start my residency there, become a consultant and practice in my country.  ""The main reason I left is salary, and the cost of living. In the UK, if I work six to eight hours of locum work [overtime] and I convert that to naira, it will be the equivalent of my monthly salary in Nigeria. And that's not even including my main UK salary."" He says a year ago his hospital in Nigeria started haemorrhaging doctors. ""Some doctors didn't get paid for six to nine months, because there was an issue with the federal payment system. Some senior colleagues couldn't afford to drive to work or send their children to school. That was an eye-opener for a lot of people."" His wife and children are planning to join him in Scotland soon. When I ask him what he thinks the future holds for Nigeria, he grows pensive.  ""If I think about it too much, it's depressing because even people currently in medical school are all planning to leave. If you aren't planning to leave, people think you're unfortunate or you don't have money."" I have spoken to half a dozen doctors, all with similar stories. Overworked and underpaid, they all decided to relocate over the past two years.  For those left behind, the pressure is immense. Cheta Nwanze, an economic analyst at SBM Intelligence, says Nigeria's current high rate of inflation is mainly caused by food inflation.  ""SBM has this proxy for food inflation called the Jollof Index,"" he explains, referring to the tomato-based rice dish, popular across West Africa. ""We calculate the average cost of making a pot of jollof rice for a family of five. It was just under 4,000 naira at the start of 2016, and now it's around 10,000 naira [$22, Â£18] - so it's more than doubled in five years.""  He explains that although Nigeria has been affected by some of the same drivers of inflation as elsewhere in the world, namely the war in Ukraine and the 2020 pandemic, there are additional factors unique to the country. He says that many farmers in the north, where much of the country's food comes from, have been unable to plant their crops in recent years because of attacks by Islamist militants and kidnappers. ""When you couple that with the government's protectionist policies with respect to food imports, and Nigeria's growing population, it means there's less food for more mouths to feed, which drives up inflation."" The impact of this can be seen in the country's markets. In Ajah, a small food market in a residential suburb of Lagos, there are fewer people than usual.  Omowunmi Ajekigbe, a market trader, is grating okra under a huge parasol. ""Things weren't too expensive last year,"" she tells me, ""but this year, it's too much. You used to see lots of customers rushing about, but now... you barely see anybody.  At a nearby stall, Cordelia Fidelis, a young woman with long braids and a big smile, is haggling with a vegetable seller. She owns a catering business and comes to the market every day.  ""The cost of goods is alarming - in just two months the price of yams has more than doubled. It's crazy, I swear it's crazy, everything is so expensive. A box of egg is expensive, beef is expensive, palm oil is so expensive."" Some have started taking drastic action to manage their expenses. Angela Chukwulozie is a retired teacher who now sells Italian shoes. ""Since the price of everything has gone up, I've cut back on how many meals my family and I eat every day. Instead of eating three times in a day we now eat twice."" The economy is one of the key concerns for voters in next month's elections. Despite being Africa's largest economy, four out of 10 Nigerians live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. All of the main candidates have promised to improve the country's economy if elected, but there is scepticism as to whether they can deliver. The Central Bank says the change of currency, which must be completed by 10 February when the old banknotes will no longer be legal tender, will help bring some of the cash currently being hoarded by individuals and companies back into the banking system. It says 80% of the notes currently in circulation are outside banks. The organisation hopes the change will give it a better understanding of the money circulating in the economy so it can better manage inflation. Whether or not it will be successful is debatable. Back in London, Oroma is optimistic, despite the hardships her country is facing.  ""There's no place like home. I go back to Nigeria every three months, because when I haven't been there, I literally feel like I'm dying.  ""I feel like Nigeria is at the point where, if we can change now, it's not too late. We just need some basics: people need to be educated, we need electricity, we need roads. If we can just do these three things and improve security, I think the potential in Nigeria is amazing.""

Thankfully, you'll probably have a team dedicated to making sure the choice of outfit is stylish, eye-catching and memorable. But sometimes, outfits can be remembered for the wrong reasons, as Zara Larsson found out. The Swedish singer hit headlines when she wore a dress featuring album art from Norwegian metal act Burzum. Unfortunately for Zara, the project was led by Norwegian musician Kristian ""Varg"" Vikernes. He's known for holding neo-Nazi views, and has been called ""anti-Semitic and xenophobic"". Vikernes also got a prison sentence for murdering a fellow metal musician and setting fire to churches in Norway. Not the best look. Zara was criticised when she appeared on TikTok, wearing the outfit at an awards show. She said she had no idea of the link, and that the design was chosen because the images looked cool. ""It was unfortunate...,"" the 25-year-old told Swedish publication Aftonbladet.  She originally said the garment wasn't Burzum merchandise and was created by Belgian fashion designer Raf Simons. Zara's team has since told BBC Newsbeat that's not quite right, and Zara's dress was actually by Dilara Findikoglu.  Zara joins a long list of celebrities to cop flak for their clothing choices. In August 2022, TikToker Addison Rae posed in a Holy Trinity bikini from the brand Praying.  The white two-piece had ""Father"" printed on one cup, ""Son"" on the other, and ""Holy Spirit"" across the front of the bottoms. After feeling the wrath and fury of some Christians, who accused her of blasphemy and disrespecting religion, Addison deleted the post from Instagram. In 2014, Khloe Kardashian wore a war bonnet - a type of native American headdress - to her niece North West's Coachella-themed birthday party. This upset indigenous groups, who object to the use of the sacred item as a fashion accessory. They were especially annoyed because, at the time, NFL team the Washington Redskins had dropped its name because the term was disparaging to Native American people. It's now known as the Washington Commanders. Khloe again faced backlash for cultural appropriation when she posted a selfie wearing a niqab - a religious covering - while on holiday. Selena Gomez was criticised for wearing a bindi at the MTV Movie Awards, with some saying the item on the forehead is a religious tradition in Hinduism and not meant as a fashion accessory. Selena said the song Come and Get It ""has that almost Hindu feel"", adding that she's ""learned a lot about the culture, and I think it's beautiful. I think it's fun to incorporate that into the performance."" Also in 2013, Katy Perry dressing as a geisha for her performance of Unconditionally at the American Music Awards caused outrage for appropriation of Japanese culture. Katy said even in her ""intention to appreciate Japanese culture, I did wrong with a performance. And I didn't know that I did it wrong until I heard people saying I did it wrong"". With so many big names catching heat over the years, what exactly is the process behind dressing a celebrity? According to celeb stylist Alex Longmore, there is often a ""really long process"" that goes with creating a look for celebrities. ""Different celebs have different looks. So a musician or someone who is in a band, their persona is so massive,"" says Alex, who has worked with the likes of Little Mix, tells BBC Newsbeat. With A-list stars in particular, she says there is ""huge amounts of pressure"" to get it right. ""They want to create uniqueness, they want to be cutting edge, they want to be telling a story and they want to grab headlines."" Stylists, she says, work with artists but also the management. ""So it's a big massive production, working with a pop star. And so much prep goes into it, because they can't be seen to be wearing something that someone else has worn.""  As for avoiding items which can offend people - Alex says in her experience, there are no real checks that take place. ""I think basically someone [in Zara's case] hasn't checked and it's one of those things that has such huge ramifications.""  ""But it's such a simple error. They just haven't thought it through.""

107,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,Ukraine war: How two mothers retrieved their dead sons from the battlefield,"With little help from the military to bring the soldiers' bodies home, two mothers took charge themselves.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64431524,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1B5C/production/_128240070_pic-6.jpg,2023-02-04T03:27:04Z,"This article contains details that some readers may find distressing. Lyudmyla Kupriychuk stood crying in a muddy field. Her ex-husband was wrapping their son's body in a blanket.  ""I was hysterical,"" she explains. ""I said: 'Are we just going to drive him home in the boot of the car?'""  ""My ex-husband yelled at me: 'Calm down, we just need to get out of here'."" The divorced couple had bought an old Mercedes and travelled hundreds of kilometres. They were behind enemy lines to retrieve the body of their dead Ukrainian soldier son and now they were ploughing through fields in Russian-occupied territory pockmarked with shell craters.  After bringing the car to a halt, Anatoliy, Lyudmyla's ex-husband, walked over to some burnt-out armoured vehicles. Bodies lay scattered on the ground. ""He tore off the uniform to see if there was a tattoo on the arm,"" Ms Kupriychuk said. ""And it was there. It said: 'Never give up'."" ""That was all we could recognise our son by,"" the 40-year-old says, her voice trembling.  ""The bodies were lying out in the open for days, in the middle of nowhere. They weren't just burnt, wild animals had gnawed at them too.""  Her son Maksym was just 20 years old. He died on the second day of the Russian invasion - 25 February 2022.  Nobody had paid much attention to a middle-aged couple arriving in the Russian-held village of Tomaryne. It's about a 90-minute drive from the southern city of Kherson.  The Russians and their allies were yet to establish their administration, so it was chaotic when the couple arrived there in March 2022. They drove outside the village and met the first manned checkpoint. ""I got out of the car and walked towards a man pointing a gun at me,"" Ms Kupriychuk recalls. ""But I wasn't scared, all I felt was revulsion for these people."" Unbelievably, she says, she managed to cajole the soldiers to let them through. She showed them a photograph of her son's body and they drove to the field where Maksym died. Then, with his body in the boot, the couple started their 12-hour journey home to Vinnytsia, in central Ukraine.  There is no official data on the number of Ukrainian military deaths or missing bodies - that is classified information. As a professional soldier based in Lviv in western Ukraine, Maksym had not told his mother that his air assault force had been sent south to stop the Russian offensive. She was shocked when his girlfriend phoned and announced his death. One of Maksym's colleagues had a photo of the field where he had been killed and said his body was still there. He told her that Maksym had come under shelling, but there was no other information about the circumstances of his death.  Ms Kupriychuk phoned Maksym's military unit, and they told her to wait for information. ""Every night I was going berserk knowing that my son was lying out there in the freezing cold and there was nothing to cover him,"" she says. Days later as dawn broke, Maksym's parents set off to find him and bring his body home. They had no plan - just the photo, the village name and a contact for a local who had volunteered to guide them. Ukraine's Presidential Envoy for Servicemen's Rights, Alyona Verbytska, says 15,000 Ukrainians civilians and military personnel went missing between February and the end of 2022. They could have been killed or captured. On the Russian side, up to 600 soldiers are missing in Ukrainian territory, excluding occupied areas, according to data from the BBC's Russian service. People are using any means they can to find their loved ones.  A famous TV anchor started a countrywide project to help with the search, and Ukrainians have also donated money for equipment such as refrigerated vans to evacuate the bodies of soldiers and return them to their families. In social media groups on Facebook and Telegram, people share information about the missing and ask for help. Natalya Karpova, also from Vinnytsia, was searching for her son, Roman. She found a photo of his body on a Russian Telegram channel in April. Russian military personnel post on these instant messaging channels, and they are often the only source of information from occupied areas. The post suggested that a sniper had killed the 30-year-old engineer. Friends of Roman called to tell her of his death, saying he'd died at the end of April. That prompted her online search. When she found the photo, she called his air force unit. ""They said it was fake and I shouldn't be relying on the aggressor's media for information,"" she says. ""They said: 'We don't have any document [saying] that your son has died'."" Ukraine's military does not comment on missing soldiers as per martial law, which means families often have to wait for the government or volunteers to help return a body. Ms Karpova, a 59-year-old doctor, quit her job to focus on finding Roman's body herself. She knew he had gone to the frontline, but not which one. The picture posted on Telegram showed his ID and gave an approximate location in eastern Ukraine.  With help from another part of the military, a drone was flown over the site, and they located his body near the village of Dovhenke, outside Izyum city in eastern Ukraine. But heavy fighting and the Russian occupation kept it off limits. Eventually, there was a breakthrough. Ukraine liberated the village in September 2022. ""It was autumn, I knew we had no time to waste,"" she says. ""When winter comes and snow falls, there would be nothing left of the body."" She quickly assembled a search team with help from local politicians and activists, as well as the military.  Under thick vegetation, and in an area full of landmines, they found Roman's body, using his military dog tag to identify him. ""I felt a load fall off my shoulders,"" his mother says, her voice breaking. ""You cannot imagine what it feels like to be unable to take your son's body home and bury him."" His body was buried back in his home city of Vinnytsia. The air force told the BBC that heavy fighting and Russia's occupation meant Roman's unit was unaware of all the deaths at the time. On returning to Vinnytsia, Ms Kupriychuk took Maksym's body straight to the morgue. ""All they let me see was my son's hand,"" she says. ""They didn't let me see his body as his head was gone."" She has turned Maksym's bedroom into a shrine. It's full of photos of him smiling as well as a bottle of his cologne and some handcrafts he made for her as a schoolboy. She takes his uniform from the wardrobe and pulls it close to her, as if hugging him. ""Nothing has changed here since he died,"" she says. For Ms Karpova, the fact she found and buried her son has brought no peace. ""My husband and I can't believe he's dead,"" she says. Ms Karpova adds that she got no support from the air force to find him, though a general later thanked her for finding Roman's body. ""I want victory now so no other mother finds herself in my situation,"" she says. The BBC was unable to reach Maksym's military unit for comment on the circumstances of his death. Â© 2023 BBC.

But as BBC News Mundo's Norberto Paredes reports from Caracas, while some of those living in the capital's poorest neighbourhoods are trying to make the most of the new opportunities opening up, many have yet to feel the benefits of the apparent economic rebound.  ""I was about to turn 15 and I wasn't sure if I wanted a party, a present or just the funds to open a small ice cream shop,"" says Aray Arias Torres of the decision that led her to become one of the latest young entrepreneurs to set up shop in Barrio San Blas, one of Caracas' most dangerous neighbourhoods. Foregoing the traditional party held in Venezuela when a girl turns 15, Aray decided to use the money gifted to her by friends and relatives to ""help my mum and family make money"". She set up a little ice cream parlour where she sells sorbets at prices ranging between $2 (Â£1.63) and $8 (Â£6.51). Venezuela's national currency is the bolivar, but during a four-year period of hyperinflation, it became almost worthless. While the government says that the yearly inflation rate dropped from 686% in 2021 to 234% in 2022, it remains one of the highest in the world.   Unsurprisingly, those who can try to get hold of more stable foreign currencies instead. But strict foreign currency controls put in place by former President Hugo ChÃ¡vez meant that until recently they were beyond the reach of most Venezuelans. A loosening of the currency controls in 2019 by NicolÃ¡s Maduro, ChÃ¡vez's successor in office, has led to what some call a de-facto dollarisation. Many shops, like Aray's ice-cream parlour, display prices in dollars above those in bolivars and prefer to trade in the US currency. But this has created a two-tier society in which the minority of Venezuelans who are paid their salaries in dollars, or who receive remittances from relatives abroad, can afford luxuries which those paid in bolivars can only dream of. The minimum wage for workers in the public sector - Venezuela's largest employer - is 130 bolivars per month (about $6; Â£4.85), which means that Aray's sorbets are only affordable to a select few. Nevertheless, the government has been boasting about the economic growth the country is experiencing. It says that in 2022 the economy grew 15%, thanks to rising oil production along with President Maduro's decision to relax price and currency controls and allow more transactions in foreign currencies. The Economic Commission for Latin America (Cepal) puts that growth at a more modest figure of 10%. But either way it is undeniably a surprising turnaround from the eight previous years, in which Venezuela's gross domestic product is estimated to have contracted by more than 75%. But economist Luis Vicente LeÃ³n warns that while the economic rebound is noticeable, it has not been felt by everyone. ""It is growth that is concentrated, as usually happens, in the non-tradable sectors of the economy, that is, commerce, services, technology, distribution, and health,"" he explains. ""Neither all sectors, regions, nor all social classes have experienced growth in a the same way,"" adds Mr LeÃ³n, who is president of the Caracas-based research firm DatanÃ¡lisis.  MarÃ­a Cayone, 41, is one of those who has yet to see any change to her life.  ""Where has the economy improved? For whom?"" she asks, sitting outside her home along with her two youngest children in the impoverished Petare neighbourhood. ""People here in Petare have turned to the informal economy,"" she says while sitting at a makeshift stall in front of her house from which she sells homemade ice cream and wafers.  MarÃ­a, who has six children, explains that she earns very little selling food on her doorstep. But she argues that by working from home she at least does not waste money on public transport. She says that the most she could expect to make in a month, were she to take a job in the city centre, would be $20, which would not even cover the $2 daily fare to take her there.  MarÃ­a's situation is far from unique. A recent survey by the AndrÃ©s Bello Catholic University revealed that while the number of those living in poverty in Venezuela had fallen from 65.2% in 2021 to 50.5% in 2022, income inequality had continued to widen.  The poorest 10% in Venezuela survive on just $8 a month, compared to $553 for the country's richest 10%, explains researcher Luis Pedro EspaÃ±a, who worked on the Living Conditions Survey (Encovi). According to the same report, Venezuela is now the most unequal nation in Latin America. That inequality is clearly visible in Petare, where Yeidis Morales has turned her garage into a small restaurant. The prices she charges for a combo of soup, main dish and juice are not affordable to everyone here. The only two customers that lunchtime, two teenagers, turned around and left as soon as they heard that lunch cost $5.  Yeidis says that business fluctuates - sometimes she sells as little as one lunch per day, while on good days she serves up to 15. Prices for shop-bought food in Petare also rival - and sometimes exceed - those in many European capitals such as Madrid or Lisbon.  In local shops, a kilogram of chicken fillets costs about $4.50, a local cheese around $5, and a litre of fresh milk $2.30. Former bus driver Miguel Ãngel GarcÃ­a, who lives off his $6-monthly pension and a remittance of $100 his daughter sends him every month from neighbouring Colombia, thinks it will take a long time for the country to get back to normal.  ""Venezuela is finished and it will take many years before it gets better,"" the 72-year-old says. Economist Luis Vicente LeÃ³n agrees that the Venezuelan economy still has ""very long way"" to go to recover. ""Venezuela would have to grow 346% to recover the lost ground. It would need 20 years of great economic growth for it to have the economy it had in 2013."" The economist also warns that if the government does not solve the country's underlying economic problems, growth is likely to slow down and stagnate. ""You cannot deny that the economy is growing... but if you look beyond the areas where there have been improvements, you see a country still in ruins."" But there are some, like Aray, who are more optimistic about the future. She hopes that her ice cream shop will flourish so she can fulfil her dream of opening a cafÃ© and maybe even a business for her mother. Â© 2023 BBC.

In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said Estonia had ""purposefully destroyed"" relations with Moscow.  Margus Laidre is the first ambassador Russia has expelled since invading Ukraine last year.  Estonia responded by asking the Russian ambassador to leave by the same date.  Russia's move against Mr Laidre comes after Estonia recently ordered a reduction in the size of the Russian Embassy in Tallinn. Moscow was told to reduce its embassy from 17 to eight by the end of January. In a statement in January, Estonia said embassy staff had stopped seeking to advance relations between the countries since the conflict broke out.  Tensions were also raised last week after representatives from 11 Nato nations gathered at an army base in Estonia to discuss a range of new packages to help Ukraine recapture territory and fend off any further Russian advances.  Latvia's foreign ministry has also asked the Russian ambassador to leave by 24 February and said the country would support Estonia by reducing diplomatic relations with Russia. Mr Laidre has been appointed to the Russian Federation since 2018 and has previously held the role in the UK and Finland.  He was working from the Estonian Embassy in Moscow, and will now be replaced with a chargÃ© d'affaires - a diplomat of a lower rank acting in place of an ambassador.  The statement from the Russian foreign ministry said: ""In recent years, the Estonian leadership has purposefully destroyed the entire range of relations with Russia. Total Russophobia, the cultivation of hostility towards our country has been elevated by Tallinn to the rank of state policy. ""Now Estonia has taken a new unfriendly step to radically reduce the number of personnel of the Russian embassy in Tallinn, confirming the line towards the collapse of relations between our countries. As a response, the Russian side decided to downgrade the diplomatic representative in both countries to chargÃ© d'affaires."" The press release added that Mr Laidre was summoned to the ministry on Monday where he was asked to leave the country. The statement ended by stating that the development of the two countries' relationship now lies with Estonia. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The current chief of staff, Ron Klain, is to step down after the State Of The Union address on 7 February, the New York Times has reported. US media reported that an announcement was expected on Monday. Mr Zients refused to comment on the reports when approached by the BBC's US partner CBS News. The role is considered to be one of the most important at the White House. The chief of staff is responsible for driving the president's policy agenda and hiring staff. Mr Zients left his role as the Covid policy coordinator last April but had since returned to assist with the November midterm elections.  He worked across various administrations including as an economic advisor to Barack Obama in 2009. In the private sector, he attempted to take over ownership of the Washington Nationals but was unsuccessful. Mr Zients was credited for his work as Covid coordinator as he lead the nationwide vaccination campaign, but faced criticism that the administration did not do enough to boost testing. His return to the White House comes at a crucial moment for the US president as his staff begin to turn their attention to a potential re-election campaign in 2024. President Biden is also facing a special counsel investigation into the handling of classified documents found at his private office and at his home in Delaware. Some Democrats had hoped Mr Biden may have chosen a woman for the role, the Washington Post reported.  Mr Klain was the longest serving chief of staff of any Democratic president. He worked as one of Mr Biden's top aides for years - in both the Senate and when Mr Biden was vice-president. He also worked as an adviser and speechwriter on Mr Biden's unsuccessful 1988 and 2008 White House campaigns and was a senior aide to Barack Obama. Former US president Donald Tump had four chiefs of staff in four years.  Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

113,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,Ukraine war: Hiding from Putin's call up by living off-grid in a freezing forest,Adam Kalinin has been camping in the Russian wilderness since September to avoid fighting in Ukraine.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64346971,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/103CA/production/_128360566_mediaitem128360565.jpg,2023-01-22T00:44:36Z,"When Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation of Russian men in September last year, it took Adam Kalinin - not his real name - a week to decide that the best thing he could do was move to the forest. The IT specialist was against the war from the start, receiving a fine and spending two weeks in detention for sticking a poster saying ""No to war"" on the wall of his apartment building.  So when Russia said it was calling up 300,000 men to help turn things around in a war it was losing, Kalinin did not want to risk being sent to the front line to kill Ukrainians.  But, unlike hundreds of thousands of others, he did not want to leave the country.  Three things kept him in Russia: friends, financial constraints and an unease about abandoning what he knows.  ""Leaving would have been a difficult step out of my comfort zone,"" Kalinin, who is in his thirties, told the BBC. ""It isn't exactly comfortable here either but nevertheless, psychologically, it would be really hard to leave."" And so he took the unusual step of saying goodbye to his wife and heading for the forest, where he has lived in a tent for nearly four months.  He uses an antenna tied to a tree for internet access and solar panels for energy.  He has endured temperatures as low as -11C (12F) and exists on food supplies brought to him regularly by his wife.  Living off-grid, he says, is the best way he can think of to avoid being called up. If the authorities can't hand him a summons in person, he can't be forced to go to war.  ""If they are physically unable to take me by the hands and lead me to the enlistment office, that is a 99% defence against mobilisation or other harassment."" In some ways, Kalinin continues his life as before. He still works eight hours a day in the same job, although throughout winter - with its limited daylight - he doesn't have enough solar power to work full days and so makes up his hours on the weekend.  Some of his colleagues are now in Kazakhstan, having also left Russia after mobilisation began, but his internet connection via a long-range antenna strapped to a pine tree is reliable enough that communication is not a problem.  He is also a lover of the outdoors, spending many of his past holidays camping in southern Russia with his wife. When he made the decision to move permanently to the wilderness, he already had much of the equipment he needed.  His wife, who visited Kalinin's camp for a couple of days over the new year, plays a big role in his survival. She brings supplies every three weeks to a drop-off point where they are briefly able to see each other in person. He then takes the supplies away to a safe place which he visits every few days to stock up. He cooks using a makeshift wood-burning stove.  ""I have oats, buckwheat, tea, coffee, sugar. Not enough fresh fruit and vegetables of course, but it's not too bad,"" he says.  Kalinin's new home is a large tent of the type used for ice-fishing. When he first arrived in the forest, he set up two camps five minutes apart; one with internet access where he worked, the other in a more sheltered spot where he slept.  As winter approached and the weather got colder, he brought the two areas together to live and work under one canvas.  Recently, the temperature dropped to -11C, colder than he had expected. But now the days are getting longer again and the snow is beginning to melt, he plans to stay where he is.  Although Kalinin hasn't received a call-up himself, he says the situation is constantly changing and he fears he could receive a summons in the future. Officially, IT workers like Kalinin are exempt from the draft, but there are numerous reports in Russia of similar exemptions being ignored.  Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the mobilisation on 21 September, shortly after Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region during which it reclaimed thousands of square kilometres of territory from Russian troops.  He said the mobilisation was necessary to defend Russia against the West. But many in the country protested, and there were chaotic scenes on Russia's borders as hundreds of thousands of people fled. The call-up had a profound effect on Russia. Until then, many Russians were able to continue their lives much as they had before the war. True, some Western brands disappeared and sanctions made financial transactions more difficult, but the direct impact on society was mostly limited.  Mobilisation brought the war crashing on to the doorsteps of many Russian families. Suddenly, sons, fathers and brothers were deployed to the front line at short notice, often with poor equipment and minimal training. If the conflict seemed distant before, now it was all but impossible to ignore.  Yet, public acts of protests are rare inside Russia - something that has been criticised in Ukraine and in the West. But Kalinin says people are rightly scared of what might happen to them.  ""We have a totalitarian state that has become so powerful. In the last six months, laws have been brought in at an incredible pace. If a person speaks out now against the war, the state will pursue them.""  Kalinin's life in the forest has brought him a certain level of popularity online, with 17,000 people following his near-daily updates on Telegram. He posts videos and photos of his surroundings, his daily routine, and of how his camp is organised. Wood-chopping features heavily.  Kalinin claims not to miss much about his previous life. He calls himself an introvert who doesn't mind being alone, although he misses his wife and would like to see her more often. However, he points out that his current situation is still preferable to being sent to the front line or to prison.  ""I've changed so much, that the kind of things I might have missed have faded into the background,"" he says. ""The things that seemed important before don't have their power any more. There are people in a much worse situation than us."" Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "
114,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,Obituary: Pervez Musharraf,Pakistan's military ruler found himself on the front line between militant Islamists and the West.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22248479,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/135BD/production/_114239297_gettyimages-186504819.jpg,2023-02-05T07:19:02Z,"The political career of Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's most recent military ruler who has died aged 79, was defined by its extremes.  After seizing power in a 1999 coup, Musharraf went on to survive numerous assassination attempts - finding himself on the front line of the struggle between militant Islam and the West. Notably, he formed an alliance with the United States, claiming it helped him modernise Pakistan and improve the economy.  But by 2008, the career soldier had suffered defeat at the polls and was forced from office. His political career ultimately ended in disgrace and arrest: he was sentenced to death in absentia for treason in 2019. He had been allowed to leave Pakistan in 2016 to receive medical treatment, meaning the sentence was unlikely ever to be carried out. But it was a humiliating first for the military, which has ruled the country for long spells. In June 2022, following premature reports Musharraf had died in Dubai, his family announced there was little chance he would recover from multiple organ failure linked to a rare disease from which he suffered, amyloidosis. Pervez Musharraf was born in Delhi on 11 August 1943, but his family joined millions of other Muslims in the newly created Pakistan, following the partition of India in 1947 after British rule ended. He attended school in Karachi and Lahore before entering the Pakistan Military Academy in 1961. He served in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965 and in the second conflict between the countries five years later, by which time he was a company commander. Musharraf rose to the top job in 1998 when Pakistan's army chief, Gen Jehangir Karamat, resigned two days after calling for the army to be given a key role in the country's decision-making process. Many observers took the resignation as a sign that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's political power had become strong enough to secure the long-term future of civilian administrations. In October 1999, Prime Minister Sharif attempted to dismiss Musharraf from his position, but the move was opposed by senior army officers. Musharraf, who was out of the country at the time, quickly returned to Pakistan and seized power in a bloodless coup - taking the title of chief executive. Pakistan's then President Rafiq Tarar remained in office until June 2001 when Musharraf formally appointed himself as his replacement. Any thoughts his takeover might herald a stabilisation in ties with neighbouring India - or even a new start - were dashed early in his rule. There was optimism when he visited India for a landmark summit in July 2001, holding talks with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and also fitting in a photo opportunity with a visit to the Musharraf family's ancestral home in Delhi. But hope waned and the talks ended without agreement - the long-running dispute over Kashmir was seen as the main reason for the deadlock. India regarded Musharraf as the architect of the 1999 conflict in Kargil, and suspected Pakistan's army of involvement in the hijack of an Indian Airlines plane to Afghanistan the same year.  This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons As Pakistan's leader, Musharraf had to deal with the fallout for his own country from the 11 September 2001 attacks by Islamist militants on targets in the United States.  The blunt message from the administration of then US President George W Bush was, ""You are either with us or against us."" So Musharraf made a controversial U-turn on Pakistani policy: supporting the American-led military campaign to oust the Taliban regime in neighbouring Afghanistan, who had harboured Muslim radicals blamed for the attacks. In January 2002, he issued a strong condemnation of extremism, pledging to fight Islamist terrorism in Pakistan. He also banned all foreign funding of mosques and Islamic education centres and limited the numbers of foreign students coming to Pakistan for Islamic studies. The new president also found himself under increasing pressure to hold democratic elections and restore civilian rule. In October 2002, a pro-Musharraf coalition won the majority of parliamentary seats, although the opposition effectively blocked any proceedings in the National Assembly for more than 12 months.  Two years later, he struck a deal with a coalition of Islamic parties that saw a measure passed which legitimised his 1999 coup and allowed him to remain in the army and retain the title of president. Turning around the decline in economic growth was part of President Musharraf's promise on assuming power and his reforms were generally praised by international institutions. Musharraf had to cope with a humanitarian tragedy in October 2005, when a massive earthquake hit Pakistan-administered Kashmir, killing more than 73,000 people and making more than three million homeless.  The pressure on his rule increased during 2007 following his decision to suspend the Chief Justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, accusing him of corruption. A huge protest by the country's lawyers saw the Supreme Court eventually reinstate the chief justice and dismiss all allegations of misconduct. In July 2007, the army laid siege to the Red Mosque in Islamabad, whose religious leaders and students had regularly condemned Musharraf's pro-Western policy. Armed students battled with soldiers for days, before the building was raided in a military operation in which more than 100 people were killed.  In November that year, Musharraf made what would turn out to be a fateful decision - he imposed a state of emergency. His attempt to suspend the constitution and replace Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry came a month after a disputed election that had seen him returned as president.  But imposing emergency rule also set him at odds with both the opposition and some of his key international partners - and his popularity sank. But it was the shocking assassination of another former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, by a suicide bomber in December 2007, that did more than anything else to undermine Musharraf's claims that Pakistan's future was secure in his hands.  Following elections in early 2008, Bhutto's resurgent Pakistan People's Party swept to power at the head of a governing coalition that included the party of Nawaz Sharif, whom Musharraf had deposed in 1999. They began moves to force the president to resign and to begin a process of impeachment. On 18 August 2008, Musharraf announced his resignation in a long speech, during which he defended the decisions he had taken. He retired to what seemed to be a quiet life in London and Dubai, but made no secret of his wish to return. The former general eventually travelled to Pakistan in March 2013 to take part in elections, but was barred from standing by the government of Nawaz Sharif, then back in power as prime minister, and his All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) performed badly. Musharraf then became quickly embroiled in a slew of investigations, including one for treason relating to his imposition of the 2007 state of emergency. The accusations led to years of legal wrangling in the country's highest courts.  In 2016, after a travel ban had been lifted for medical reasons, Musharraf left the country again.  It took more than three years for the judges in the treason case to hand down their shock ruling: Musharraf was guilty and was sentenced to death. But with Musharraf in self-imposed exile in Dubai, there was little chance of such a sentence ever being carried out.  In a video statement from a hospital bed, he said he was too sick to travel to Pakistan. Then in another twist, a month after the sentence was delivered, the entire process was declared unconstitutional by Lahore's high court.  It threw doubt on the legitimacy of the verdict, but it wasn't clear if it automatically nullified his death sentence. After Musharraf's family announced in June 2022 that his organs were malfunctioning, there were calls for him to be allowed to return to die in peace at home in Pakistan. The army made clear it would support the family if that was what they wanted. But many others called for the former military chief to be arrested on return and insisted he be made to answer for his crimes. Â© 2023 BBC.

You can track the trajectory of China's response to its balloon just as the Pentagon was tracking the trajectory of a high-altitude piece of equipment destined to be blown out of the sky. We're investigating; we regret that it is our weather balloon blown off course; we think US politicians and media are hyping this up; everyone stay calm; the US attack on this airship is a serious violation of international practice. With Antony Blinken - the US's top diplomat - scheduled to visit China this week, Beijing had initially tried to reassure Washington this had all been an accident.  But once it became clear that the secretary of state wasn't coming, and that the balloon was not coming back either, the gloves were off. It is a long way from where the Chinese government wanted things to be at this moment. The US Secretary of State was supposed to be here building bridges or at least trying to stop those that still exist from being destroyed. Make no mistake. Chinese President Xi Jinping had great hopes for this visit and was, reportedly, even going to meet Mr Blinken himself. So what balloon-gathered intelligence could be so good that it was worth scuppering this process?  The short answer is none. Which is why many analysts think that, even if it was to some extent spying, the deployment of this balloon, in this way, at this time, had to have been an error on the Chinese side.  And, if that is the case, somebody is getting hauled over the coals for it, especially given that there are now two of these high-altitude balloons in play, with another floating above Latin America. There has been no word whether it too is supposed to have been blown wildly off course, given its ""limited self-steering capability"". Internationally, many seem to imagine that China's Communist Party is an all-knowing, locked in, organ of power - something along the lines of a giant, efficient, supercomputer with Xi Jinping toggling the controls. It is a massive, sprawling organisation, that is certain. However, it is also made up of departments and power blocks competing for influence, at times hoarding information and even deliberately not foreshadowing their actions lest a rival gain some unwanted advantage. When a clearly visible, equipment-carrying balloon started floating close to US nuclear missile siloes, the assumption from some had been not only that it was spying but that it must have been sent as a message to the Biden administration. But when you consider the damage it has done in terms of derailing a visit that the Chinese government, right up to the very top, wanted to happen, it is hard to see how this analysis stacks up. We know that the Blinken trip was important here because we saw how Beijing tried to save it using quite conciliatory language. ""The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure,"" a foreign ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying. The extent to which it was deployed to study the weather or spy doesn't really matter in terms of understanding how crushing this incident has been for those on both sides who have been looking for ways to ease US-China tensions. An enormous breakthrough was not expected from Mr Blinken's meetings in Beijing. The meetings themselves were to be the breakthrough. They would have spoken about moves towards a set of ""guard rails"", means of communication and lines not to cross in an attempt to prevent a drift towards armed conflict. President Xi also wanted it because he's looking for some big signs back at home that his administration knows what it is doing when it comes to steering China into the future. A sudden and embarrassing retreat from the zero-Covid approach came just months after China's leader had declared at the Party Congress that there would be no swerving from it. Then the speed of the about-face led to overcrowded hospital emergency rooms, medicine shortages and an unknown Covid death toll. The government now needs to put all this behind it and encourage an image of a China which is turning around economically and opening up again. A high-level US visit would have been quite useful in this regard. Examine the protestations from the major superpowers this week.  Washington has said this was a ""clear violation of US sovereignty"" but we all know that it has plenty of its own very sophisticated means of spying on China. Beijing has condemned this US ""attack on a civilian unmanned airship"" but we all know that if a US surveillance balloon flew into Chinese airspace the People's Liberation Army would have it down in no time. In a way, this means that the outrage from both sides contains a fair bit of theatre.  The upside is that, now the balloon is no more, they will be able to move on from it and reschedule a Beijing visit by Mr Blinken at a time when people are asking each other, ""hey do you remember that whole balloon thing?"".

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier called off a visit to Beijing, saying the ""surveillance"" balloon's presence was ""an irresponsible act"". Later the US reported a second Chinese balloon floating over Latin America. China expressed regret over the balloon over the US, saying it was a weather airship that had been blown astray. It was last spotted over Missouri. It is expected to reach America's east coast near the Carolinas this weekend. The US has decided not to shoot down the high-altitude airship due to the danger of falling debris. The incident comes amid fraying tensions between the US and China. In a statement on Saturday, the Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing ""never violated the territory and airspace of any sovereign country"". It said its senior foreign policy official Wang Yi had discussed the incident with Mr Blinken over the phone, stressing that maintaining communication channels at all levels was important, ""especially in dealing with some unexpected situations in a calm and reliable manner"".  It added that Beijing ""would not accept any groundless conjecture or hype"" and accused ""some politicians and media in the United States"" of using the incident ""as a pretext to attack and smear China."" According to US officials, the airship floated over Alaska and Canada before appearing over the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive nuclear missile sites. The incident angered top US officials, with Mr Blinken saying he had told Beijing the balloon's presence was ""a clear violation of US sovereignty and international law"" and ""an irresponsible act"". He called it ""unacceptable"" and ""even more irresponsible coming on the eve of a long-planned visit"". America's top diplomat had been set to visit Beijing from 5 to 6 February to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19. It would have been the first high-level US-China meeting there in years. But on Thursday, US defence officials announced they were tracking a giant surveillance balloon over the US. This video can not be played Watch: 'At first I thought it was a star' While the balloon was, the Pentagon said, ""travelling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic"" and did ""not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground"", its presence sparked outrage. On Friday, China finally acknowledged the balloon was its property, saying that it was a civilian airship used for meteorological research, which deviated from its route because of bad weather. And late on Friday, the Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted - this time over Latin America. ""We are seeing reports of a balloon transiting Latin America. We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,"" said Pentagon press secretary Brig Gen Patrick Ryder.  He provided no further details about its location, but there have been reported sightings over Costa Rica and Venezuela. China has so far made no public comments on the reported second balloon.

117,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,Andrew Tate: Inside the Romanian town where brothers' empire began,"""Arrogant"", ""discreet"" - Lucy Williamson visits the apartment block where the brothers first settled.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64523028,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1739C/production/_128523159_gettyimages-1246526206-1.jpg,2023-02-05T00:32:54Z,"The villa at the end of Strada Narciselor sits at the end of a perilous road, surrounded by the fir-covered peaks of the Carpathian Mountains. Andrew Tate's first Romanian address is a far cry from the glitzy lifestyle he paraded in Bucharest before his detention - it's a squat, three-storey building with yellow walls, a short drive from the village of Sacele.   The long drive there from Bucharest winds through mile after mile of snow-muffled forest, branches iced thickly to their tips, mountains sloping towards the horizon - it's like driving through a Christmas card.  Outside Sacele, the icy track narrows to the width of a car as it climbs towards the villa, a sheer drop on one side. No Ferraris here. A Dacia and a Skoda sit parked between slushy snowdrifts outside the building. Inside it's divided into small functional apartments. This is where, in apartments 9 and 17, the Tate brothers began building their Romanian business empire. Vasile Mezdrea, a local developer, sold them the properties ""in 2015, or early 2016"" for less than â¬35,000 ($37,900; Â£31,425) each. ""They paid in instalments because they didn't have the money to buy the flats outright,"" he told me. ""They had no car in those days - they used to take their girlfriends out shopping in taxis."" He says that Andrew moved here with a British girlfriend, Melissa, who bought a third apartment in the same block.  But, according to locals, she wasn't the only woman living here with the brothers. Several people told us that other women were either living in their apartments or visiting regularly. One, who didn't want to be named, said he had received complaints that naked women were clearly visible in the Tates' ground floor apartment. Inside the block, there are few people who remember the Tates. And those who do are keen not to speak on the record. ""They were contemptuous, arrogant,"" one said. But ""very discreet - there was no music, no fights"". She said their dog, a German Shepherd, was left loose to wander the building, at one point attacking one of the residents there, and leaving her with bruises.  Complaints to the brothers reportedly went unanswered.  Seven years on, the brothers are reportedly worth millions, with a Bucharest lifestyle of designer watches, private jets and an extensive property portfolio. In Sacele itself, with its post office, pizza restaurant and slot machines, the Tates are remembered most vividly for their recent return visits - their new flashy cars were unmissable. Vasile Mezdrea says they moved to Romania because it ""has beautiful women and it's cheaper to live"".  But he says the brothers had ambitions beyond Sacele. ""They always wanted more,"" he told me. Sacele might seem like an unlikely place for the two young British kickboxers to start out, but it reveals a connection with two people who would go on to play key roles in their lives. One is a businessman called Sebastian Vieru, who first brought the Tate brothers to Romania in 2014. Originally from the Brasov region around Sacele, Mr Vieru flew them out several times to act as coaches and commentators for his cage-fighting shows. It was Mr Vieru who told the Tates about Vasile Mezdrea's new apartment block outside Sarcele, advising them that the developer urgently needed funds to finish the building, and that they would get the apartments at a discount.  He says Andrew and Tristan Tate brought some money with them from the UK, but that their wealth grew quickly once in Romania. Tracing that wealth - how it was made and where it came from - is believed to form part of the investigation into rape and human trafficking allegations currently being carried out by Romania's organised crime unit. The properties in Sacele seem to have made them very little. They sold them a couple of years later, when they moved to Bucharest, for just a few thousand euros' profit. But they left this mountain hideaway with a new business: Talisman Enterprises makes its money from web portals, according to official Romanian records. It hasn't posted a profit since 2017. Sebastien Vieru says he acts as a financial executor for the company, which is registered to an address 15 kilometres from Sacele, owned until recently by Mr Vieru's parents. He also has a 10% stake in a real-estate company called War Room Vegas, also registered to the same address, and part-owned by Andrew Tate. The other is Andrew's girlfriend, Georgiana Naghel, a former employee in Mr Vieru's cage-fighting business. In August last year, according to official Romanian records, both Andrew and Tristan transferred all their shares in Talisman Enterprises, as well as its administration, to her. The transfer of the company to Ms Naghel, a Romanian national, came four months after police began investigating the brothers. There is no evidence the two actions are linked. Talisman Enterprises is also associated with another company that lists Ms Naghel as the sole shareholder, administrator and beneficiary; a management consultancy called New Era Learning, that was established in August 2022. There are no financial records listed for the company. A third company, a consulting firm called Groundbreaking Developments, was also transferred to Ms Naghel in August. In October, it was sold on to another company owned by Abigail Tyson, believed to be a close associate of the Tate brothers. Ms Naghel is now being held in preventative custody along with the Tate brothers and another Romanian national, Luana Radu. No charges have yet been brought against any of them. In the past few weeks, investigators have seized a wide range of assets belonging to the four suspects, including Talisman Enterprises. They have also raided a long list of properties belonging to the brothers, including a swathe of land in Brasov county, and houses in and around Bucharest. Designer watches have been seized, and the brothers' fleet of luxury cars removed from their warehouse-style compound on the outskirts of the capital. Observers believe that much of the Tates' wealth may come from their investments in a major chain of Romanian casinos, and their online training courses in Andrew Tate's rigid model of masculinity.   The investigation could well answer questions about how the pair moved from their cheap flat in the mountains to the world of Bugattis, cigars and private planes posted their on social media accounts.

Poulami had been working since 6am and she was probably going to finish at around 1am, but she welcomed the chance to chat.  In her red T-shirt with the logo ""Zomato"" in white letters, the 24-year-old explained that her job was to deliver food for India's largest restaurant food delivery app. But her passion was football, she said. She had once played for India's under-16 women's team, representing her country at international tournaments. But it hadn't worked out - her family had got into financial trouble and needed her to work. It was a brief chat and Poulami waved goodbye as she left on her bicycle to continue her deliveries.  By the morning the video had gone viral, and people had questions. How could a young woman go from a promising career in football to spending all her waking hours ferrying food around the capital of West Bengal? They wanted to hear Poulami Adhikari's story. In the low-income neighbourhood of Shibrampur where Poulami grew up, south of Kolkata's Hoogly river, they call her Bulti. It means ""God's child"", a precious gift. Poulami was raised by her aunt, after her mother died when she was two months old. Her father, a part-time taxi driver, struggled to support the family. At the age of seven, Poulami discovered the local boys playing football in the neighbourhood playground. She joined them, and because she wore shorts, Poulami's playmates initially assumed that she too was a boy.  ""But when they got to know that I am a girl, their guardians started complaining to the playground authorities and then to my aunt,"" Poulami tells the BBC. ""They'd say, 'How can a girl in shorts play football with boys?'"" Poulami was devastated.  ""I got really sad and used to cry every day back at home because I badly wanted to play."" Poulami's aunt said she would find a way to support her dream, and arranged for lessons. Poulami thrived, and she soon came to the attention of a local football coach called Anita Sarkar.  Under Sarkar's guidance, Poulami played for a girls' team in Kolkata's football league, and by the time she was 12 she was selected for India's Under-16 squad.  She made fast friends, and soon there were exciting opportunities that she couldn't have imagined. None of her family had been on a plane, but she quickly found herself flying to competitions with her best friends, playing the game she loved.  ""For me wearing the Indian jersey, representing my country at such a young age was the best moment of my career,"" she says. ""When I wore the jersey for the first time, I got goosebumps from utter happiness."" In 2013 she travelled to Sri Lanka, where she took part in qualifying matches for the South Asian Football Federation's women's junior championship. And in 2016 she travelled to Glasgow to play in the Homeless World Cup, an international street football tournament. She says she was paid around $100 a match. But there were difficulties. ""Due to my family's financial condition, we never could actually afford proper football gear,"" she says, ""nor a proper meal three times a day."" There was a major setback in 2018, when Poulami incurred an injury to her leg that needed several operations and bed rest. She says she recovered enough to play at elite level again, but another problem stopped her returning to the game. Her family needed income. Her older sister had married and moved away and Poulami had to help sustain the household.  So she abandoned her footballing dream and started taking odd jobs to support her family. In 2020, at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, more and more people turned to food delivery services, and Poulami took the opportunity to work as a food delivery agent. The latest she finishes these days is 1am. It's tiring work, and it doesn't allow her to practise as much as she'd like. She earns around 300 rupees (Â£3.00 or $3.60) a day, and the double shifts are up to 15 hours long. ""If I get a decent paying job where I could work for eight to 10 hours, then I can easily take out three to four hours of time for my football,"" she says.  When the video went viral Poulami was offered a coaching job, but it was 40km (25 miles) away from her home and she would have earned less than she does with Zomato. She says that there is a lack of will in the country, and perhaps the world, to invest in women's sport. ""If we talk about India and compare men's and women's football, a lot of people generally don't watch and care about women's football at all,"" she says. ""And similarly with cricket, I have seen people taking leave from their jobs to watch a men's cricket match, but they do not bother much about the women's cricket match. So overall women in sports are neglected."" Poulami still has hopes she can play professionally, with the proper support.  She doesn't have the right international channels on her TV to follow all women's football but she is a fan of American player Alex Morgan. She also loves Ronaldinho. ""In India, young women do not have the opportunity to make careers from sport, and it is even harder if you are from such an impoverished background as Poulami,"" says Shanti Mullick, a former striker for the India women's national football team. Mullick was the first woman footballer to receive India's prestigious Arjuna Award. ""Poulami could have been a professional, if her circumstances had been different. I hope that her story spurs us to develop and invest in women's football, so we do not have any more lost talent."" On 7 January, the All India Football Federation released a road map called Vision 2047 with the goal of developing Indian football. Its 2026 target calls for more investment in women's football, including providing a minimum salary to women's players.  Poulami says that she hopes the vision will be realised. ""There are so many Poulamis around, struggling like me.""  Photographs by Sandip Roy Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The award-winning author of My Beautiful Laundrette and The Buddha of Suburbia fell while on holiday in Rome on Boxing Day. The episode left him unable to move his arms and legs. In his first international broadcast interview, he told the World Service's Newshour how his life has changed. ""I saw Death; Death was chattering to me"" he told me, convinced he was going to die, and said he wanted to video-call his children to say goodbye, but was persuaded against it by his girlfriend, Isabella D'Amico. He eluded death but is now learning to live with his transformed circumstances. He has some feeling in his arms and legs but can't do anything.  A physiotherapist says he may be able to hold and use a fork in a few weeks. And then there is the surprise of a new and growing audience for his work: millions of people are reading the words he is dictating on his blog, about what has happened to him, but also what he is learning about himself and the human condition. He has never written like this before, preferring writing in a book with a fountain pen, and a computer for re-writes.  Now, he dictates his thoughts and has been amazed by the response; an accident that came out of an accident.  He says he has often felt alone and sleeps little, listening to the World Service, BBC Radio 3 and 4, and has had some comfort from knowing people like his writing and are rooting for him, in the midst of what he describes as despair, all the time.  The words he has been dictating have been life-affirming, dark, funny and alive to his reality.  And shifted what he thinks about disabled people: ""Suddenly, I walked through the door of sickness, and I have been transformed. ""I had never really thought about the condition of disabled people and now I know. There isn't a family in the world that will not have some experience of a disabled person. ""We are living in a world of agony and pain that I never knew existed, and I want to see the world from these people's point of view.  ""I also want to set up a charity for writers who are disabled, called Metamorphosis, after the Kafka novel.""  His friend the writer Salman Rushdie, who was attacked at a literary event in the summer last year, is in touch with him, regularly, sending amusing texts.  According to Kureishi, Rushdie does not talk about what happened to him, saying that he's very private.  ""Whereas, I do talk about what happened to me. I need to remember my identity as a writer, in the only way I can."" When I asked him if he was a patient, he said he wasn't. But he had to be.  What he wants is for his hands to come back, so he can write and type. They will, he thinks, but it could take six months.  He says of that question that sick people often ask themselves - why me? - the simple answer came from a school friend: why not me?  What makes any of us think that we will be the exception, that illness will not strike us down? Kureishi, who is nearly 70, says he is grateful that it has happened to him towards the end of his life. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands says they do more for humanity than all other terrestrial ecosystems - and yet they are disappearing at an alarming rate. The main problems are agricultural and urban expansion, as well as droughts and higher temperatures brought about by climate change. But if you have a river and a beaver it may be possible to halt this process. These furry sharp-toothed rodents build dams on waterways to create a pond, inside which they build a ""lodge"" where they can protect themselves from predators.  Their technique is to chew tree trunks until they fall, and to use the trunk and branches as building materials, along with stones at the base, and mud and plants to seal the dam's upstream wall. The dam causes flooding, slows down the flow of water and keeps it on the landscape longer. ""This transforms simple streams into thriving wetland ecosystems,"" says Emily Fairfax, an ecohydrologist at California State University. ""The amount of food and water available in their wetlands makes them ideal habitat for many different species. That's part of why beavers are what's known as a keystone species."" Over the past 50 years, Canada and several states across the US have reintroduced beavers. Initially this was done to restore beaver numbers, after they were hunted nearly to extinction for their fur and meat in the 19th Century. But the restoration of wetland ecosystems has also brought huge biodiversity benefits, including the return of many species of frogs, fish and invertebrates.  A study by Finnish researchers in 2018 found that ponds engineered by beavers contained nearly twice as many mammal species than other ponds. Weasels, otters and even moose were all more prevalent.  ""Beaver wetlands are pretty unique,"" says Nigel Willby, professor of freshwater science at University of Stirling. ""Anyone can make a pond, but beavers make amazingly good ponds for biodiversity, partly because they are shallow, littered with dead wood and generally messed about with by beavers feeding on plants, digging canals, repairing dams, building lodges etc.  ""Basically, beavers excel at creating complex wetland habitats that we'd never match."" A healthy wetland ecosystem also sequesters large amounts of carbon, and by acting as a sponge and soaking up floodwaters it can soften the impacts of climate change, scientists say. Wetlands store water during wet seasons and release it slowly during drought episodes. ""When you enter a period of drought, all the plants living in a floodplain rely on stored water in the soil to keep green and stay healthy. If they don't have much water to access they will start to wilt and wither and dry out,"" says Dr Fairfax. She and her team studied 10 different wildfires in five US states between 2000 and 2021 and found in each one beavers and their ecosystem engineering reliably created and preserved wetland habitat, even during megafire events. ""Beaver wetlands have a lot of stored water, so plants in them don't really feel droughts, they stay green and lush. And when wildfire came through, they were not burnt and we found that they stayed well-watered."" But experts say beavers are only part of the solution to restore wetlands. Other necessary measures include planting woodland along the banks of lakes and rivers, and restoration of peatland and saltmarsh, says Prof Willby.  And crucially, beavers are only found naturally in North America and Eurasia. Introducing them to inappropriate places can be counter-productive. This was demonstrated in Argentina and Chile, where beavers introduced from North America in the 1940s multiplied exponentially in the absence of predators, resulting in severe forest loss. The Global Wetlands Outlook published in 2021 by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands found the most widespread wetland deterioration in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. The drastic shrinking of Lake Chad, closer to the border of Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria in West Africa is one of the most striking examples.  It has shrunk by 90% since the 1960s mainly due to a steep rise in water demand from a rapidly growing population, unplanned irrigation and now climate-change-induced drought.  ""Conflicts, mainly between farmers and cattle-rearers, over the limited remaining water of the lake was already there and now drought is further drying it up and fighting over the water has gone worse"" says Adenike Oladosu, a wetland conservation activist in Nigeria. Barron Joseph Orr, lead scientist with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, says wetlands are often resilient ecosystems, but prolonged droughts now pose a growing threat.   ""Climate change projections show increased drought severity in drylands that could compromise wetland resilience and reduce important habitat services,"" he says. In other areas too, drought can damage wetlands, but the beaver can help protect them. There have already been more than 100 successful reintroduction projects in North America and northern Europe. In Europe the population is believed to have tripled in the last 20 years, according to Prof Willby, with beavers now re-established in most European countries. Sweden, Germany and Austria led the way, according to the Natural History Museum, but the UK followed in the early 2000s. ""The early motivation for bringing beavers back to the UK was mostly about playing a part in restoring a declining species to its native range,"" Prof Willby says. ""But the value it could have as a keystone species for other biodiversity and in natural flood management was gaining a lot more traction, and these are the arguments usually put forward now to support the local releases of translocated animals or fenced trials happening in many places.""

At least 41 people died when a bus fell into a ravine and caught fire in the south-west, while in the north-west at least 10 children drowned in a boating accident.  All the dead recovered so far at the lake were aged between seven and 14. At the bus crash site, a local official said the bodies were ""beyond recognition"". The crash occurred near the southern city of Bela, in Balochistan Province, when it was travelling to the port city of Karachi. Local official Hamza Anjum told AFP news agency that 40 bodies were found alongside three injured people, one of whom died shortly after. The two remaining survivors were in a ""serious"" condition.  The bus reportedly hit a pillar on a bridge before the crash.  ""We will investigate the causes of the accident,"" Mr Anjum said, adding that DNA tests would be used to determine the identity of the remains.  The boat capsized on Tanda Dam, a lake near Kohat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, close to the border with Afghanistan.  Local police official Mir Rauf told AFP that as well as the 10 who died, 11 children had been rescued, with six in critical condition. Another nine are believed to be missing.  The boat they were travelling on was carrying more than two dozen people on a daytrip from a local madrassa - Islamic school - when it overturned. ""A rescue operation is under way,"" Mr Rauf said. Furqan Khan, the deputy commissioner of Korat, told Reuters there had been incidents in the past and police had closed the lake for recreational trips.

He was also trying to keep a secret: a hand that was not fully formed. ""In the first days of school, I honestly felt like hiding my hand,"" he told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. ""Like nobody would ever find out."" Instead, a teacher at his Tennessee high school learnt his secret and assigned his engineering class a project: build Sergio a new hand.  ""You're supposed to be engineering, coming up with new ideas, solving issues,"" Hendersonville High School student Leslie Jaramillo told WTVF, a local CBS affiliate. ""And just making things better than how they used to be."" Sergio, born with a right hand that did not fully form, had become used to it. He learnt to write with his left hand and said he could get by with nearly everything else, figuring out techniques for basic tasks like carrying his water bottle from class to class.  The suggestion from his classmates at his school in Hendersonville, 30 minutes northeast of Nashville, came as a happy surprise. ""They ended up offering me, like, 'We could build your prosthetic hand', and I never expected it,"" Sergio told CBS. ""Like, never in a million years.""  Jeff Wilkins' class, Engineering: Design and Development, was designed to take the theoretical ""and turn it into reality"", Henderson High School principal Bob Cotter told the BBC. Sergio's robotic hand ""is a testament to the students we have here who care about each other and the programme that Jeff Wilkins has built,"" he said. The small class of students spent four weeks designing, 3D printing and sizing the prototype to Sergio's hand, and becoming friends in the process. After a month of work, they put his hand to test with a game of catch, a hobby that was once out of reach.  ""[After] living without a hand for 15 years and they actually offered me two is actually pretty cool,"" Sergio told WTVF. ""Like changed my life"" Â© 2023 BBC.

Streets in many cities fell quiet after protesters urged people to stay indoors and asked businesses to close.  Meanwhile, the military administration in the country has extended a state of emergency for six months.  The UK, US, Canada and Australia have announced fresh sanctions against army-linked firms. Large parts of Myanmar descended into chaos after the government's overthrow two years ago, displacing more than a million people.  The army had made allegations of widespread fraud in a vote held months earlier, in November 2020, which Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won with more than 80% of the vote.  The military's claims have been dismissed as baseless by the vast majority of the international community, and plans to hold new elections to cement junta rule have been dismissed as a ""sham"", including by the UN.  Thinzar Shunlei Yi, a pro-democracy activist, said resistance against the military was continuing, particularly in rural areas.  ""The main message of the silent strike is to honour the fallen heroes and heroines and to reclaim the public space as our own,"" she told the BBC, adding that the aim was to send a clear message that the military ""shall never rule us"".  Protesters also gathered outside Myanmar's embassies in Thailand and Japan, chanting anti-military slogans and holding portraits of Ms Suu Kyi. A small pro-military demonstration took place in Yangon, where an estimated 200 supporters marched through the city centre escorted part of the way by soldiers, AFP news agency reported.  Two years after the coup, which catastrophically misread the public mood in Myanmar, the statistics tell their own, dismal story.  More than 2,900 people have been killed during the junta's crackdown on dissent, according to monitoring group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. One-and-a-half million people have been displaced, 40,000 homes have been burned down, eight million children are no longer in school, and 15 million people are judged by the UN to be dangerously short of food.  Much of the country is caught up in a brutal civil war. Yet the military is still refusing to negotiate with its opponents, as it promised to do in a meeting with neighbouring countries shortly after the coup.  Instead, it has plans for an election which would almost certainly exclude Ms Suu Kyi, who resoundingly won the last election, and much of her party, the NLD. Those loyal to her are calling on citizens to boycott any poll organised by the military, arguing it would be illegitimate and impractical. The UN says these would be ""sham elections"".  The military's acknowledgement this week that it had failed to normalise the situation may force it to postpone the election - originally scheduled for August this year - having now extended the state of emergency, prolonging the grim stalemate in which Myanmar is trapped. Western nations used Wednesday's anniversary to coordinate new rounds of sanctions against the military and its supporters.  The UK targeted, among others, companies supplying aviation fuel to the military, which it said were ""enabling its barbaric air-raiding campaign in an attempt to maintain power"". British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the sanctions were aimed at ""reducing the military's access to finance, fuel, arms and equipment"".  Australia announced its first sanctions against the military, aimed at 16 individuals ""responsible for egregious human rights abuses"", as well as two major military-controlled conglomerates, which dominate the country's economy.   Sanctions by the US targeted the military-approved election commission, which ""the regime has deployed to advance its plans for deeply flawed elections"".  The National Unity Government - a parallel administration that leads opposition to the military - welcomed the sanctions, calling them ""significant measures"" to tackle the conflict, particularly air strikes by the military. It called on countries to place further ""aggressive, targeted sanctions"" on the military regime and those who supported and supplied it. Amnesty International's Montse Ferrer told the BBC that moves to stop the supply of aviation fuel to the Myanmar military were ""an important step"" but that more needed to be done.  ""Other states should follow Canada's lead in suspending the direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer - including transit, trans-shipment and brokering - of aviation fuel to Myanmar,"" she said.

In the post, MrBeast reveals that he paid for sight-restoring cataract surgery for a thousand people. But the clip, which has over 71 million views, has divided opinion with some calling it ""charity porn"". The 24-year-old, real name Jimmy Donaldson, tweeted in response to suggestions that the video was made purely for financial gain, saying the ""average MrBeast video lost $1,500,000 last year"". He also argued the video did ""raise awareness"". MrBeast, who has 131 million subscribers and recently became the world's most popular YouTuber, initially said he did not expect so many people to view the video. As more people watched the video, there were questions and concerns over the cost and inaccessibility of eye surgery in some parts of the world. Some people also suggested rich influencers should not be used to try and fix wider problems in society and healthcare.  But not everyone agrees, with some praising for him raising awareness. Andrew Hodgson, president of the National Federation of the Blind of the UK, told BBC Newsbeat: ""Anything that puts a spotlight on such treatable eye conditions like cataracts and provides funding for people to undergo surgery to restore their sight should be welcomed. ""Why would anybody criticise this work and raising awareness of it through film and social media channels?""  A spokeswoman for Sightsavers, an international charity, added they were ""encouraged to see the subject of the global eye health burden being raised to a large public audience"". ""Eye health is often a forgotten topic when it comes to global health conversations, but eye health equals opportunity, allowing children to learn and adults to earn,"" they added. One Twitter user notes ""the fact it took charity for these people to get help highlights the problem"".  But another user said ""paying for 1000 blind people to have eye surgery is a nice thing to do, but using that act of generosity into content turns it into a tacky and tasteless act of charity porn"". Dr Jeff Levenson, the surgeon who worked on behalf of the social media star, says in the video ""half of all the blindness in the world is people who need a 10 minute surgery"".  MrBeast is known for videos featuring huge cash giveaways and prizes, as well as charity work. In 2021, he launched a separate philanthropy-themed YouTube channel, which itself has more than 10 million subscribers, and he has a licensed charity that functions as a food bank to feed communities across the US. More than two million people are living with sight loss in the UK, of which 340,000 are registered as blind or partially sighted, according to the NHS.  In the instance that an individual's quality of life is impacted by their declining sight, the NHS provides assessment and surgery if and whenever necessary.  The Royal College of Optometrists reported that in the UK just under 44,000 cataract procedures were carried out in one month alone in 2021. Despite the mixed response, MrBeast's impact on those who received surgery is visible in the emotional reaction of those he helped. ""I didn't think I was ever going to see again,"" said one patient who had previously been a cashier, but had been forced to stop working when his sight loss became so advanced.

Six children were injured in the incident - including some who became trapped under the vehicle - in Laval, near Montreal, on Wednesday morning.  Police believe the suspect, Pierre Ny St-Amand, deliberately drove the bus into the daycare during the morning drop-off. But they said a motive was unclear. The 51-year-old, who had been employed as a bus driver by the local public transit system for 10 years, was charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault and assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm. While about a dozen others were injured, including the six children, police said they did not expect any more fatalities. The child victims were reported to be of preschool age.  One eyewitness, Hamdi Ben Chaabane, told CBC News that the driver exited the bus after the crash, took off his clothes and began acting erratically.  ""It was a nightmare. It's horrible. He didn't stop yelling. He wasn't saying words,"" he said. In a brief court appearance via video link, the suspect refused to speak during a hearing and was ordered by a judge to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. He appeared from a bed at a hospital in Montreal. The daycare is located on a quiet cul-de-sac in Laval and the crash happened at about 08:30 (13:30 GMT). Police had cordoned off the area by Wednesday afternoon. A crisis centre was set up nearby to help parents and families. By Wednesday evening, a makeshift memorial to the victims began to grow, as neighbours left stuffed animals and flowers in the snow.

""I don't know why but as soon as he looked at me, I started crying."" It was more than 30 hours after Monday's devastating earthquake and he was exhausted. He and just one other doctor were treating scores of injured people being brought to their hospital in Afrin, a town in opposition-held north-western Syria. Then, seven-year-old Mohammed arrived, having been dug out from beneath the rubble of his collapsed home. Rescuers found him lying beside the body of his father, who had been crushed to death along with his mother and his siblings. ""The way the boy was looking at us, I felt like he trusted us, he knew that he was in safe hands now,"" Dr Masri tells me in a Zoom call. ""But I also felt he had a lot of strength, like he was holding in the pain of his injuries. What makes a seven-year-old child so strong and resilient?"" Dr Masri is a resident surgeon at Al-Shifa Hospital, which is supported by the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), a charity. He says it received more than 200 patients in the immediate aftermath of the disaster.  Another young survivor brought in by rescuers was an 18-month-old boy. Dr Masri checked him over and established that he was fine. But he then realised that the boy's parents were not with him. ""Suddenly, I saw his father run to him and hold him, sobbing and crying,"" he says. ""The father told me this child was the only survivor in his family. The rest of the family was laid out in the corridor, dead."" Dr Masri says staff at the hospital were stunned at the scale of the catastrophe, with ""waves"" of patients arriving all at once. ""I never imagined that an earthquake could create this much damage, could lead to this number of patients.""  Sadly, he is used to dealing with major incidents. In 2013, he was working in a field hospital when rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were fired at several opposition-held suburbs of the capital, Damascus. Hundreds of people were killed and thousands of others were injured. ""At that time, we were trained and prepared, as doctors for such an event,"" Dr Masri says. ""We were able to organise ourselves quickly. But in this scenario we weren't prepared. This situation was far worse."" Following Monday's earthquake, he and his colleagues in Afrin dealt with patients who looked lightly injured at first. ""They were injuries that you think are not serious, but someone then needs to have a limb amputated,"" he says. ""We don't have the capacity in our hospitals to respond to this kind of disaster."" ""The worst thing is to be a doctor in these circumstances. When you are unable to save a patient or ease someone's pain - that's the worst thing you can feel."" As he treated patients, Dr Masri also had to deal with not knowing whether his own family was safe because the electricity supply and the internet were both down. His parents and siblings live just a few hundred metres away from the hospital, but his wife and children live across the border in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep, which was close to the epicentre and was also badly affected.  ""The worst feeling you can have during such crises is not knowing whether your family and loved ones are OK."" ""We were looking at patients with two eyes - one to assess their injuries, and the other to see whether the patient is a family member or not."" A sigh of relief came when his brother rushed to the hospital to assure Dr Masri that his whole family was safe. He also managed to have a brief rest at the hospital. ""When I slept at that point, I just collapsed,"" he says. ""There were moments where I needed someone to hold me up so I could keep working."" Dr Masri then managed to leave work and have breakfast with his family. He hopes he can eventually travel to see his wife and children in Gaziantep.  He says he also went to check on Mohammed the next day and asked the seven-year-old if he recognised him. ""Yes, you're the doctor who saved my life,"" Mohammed replied. Â© 2023 BBC.

Ms Sloek-Andersen is a senior director at global shipping giant Maersk. ""[Last summer] we had to switch a lot of cargo from river to rail in Europe,"" she says, ""in order to keep the big German industry clusters in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Bavaria and Hessen connected to the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp."" More than 300 million tonnes of goods a year are typically transported by cargo riverboats on the wide Rhine River, which flows for almost 800 miles from Switzerland to the Netherlands, where it joins the North Sea. Yet during the summer months of last year, record low water levels meant some vessels were able to carry just 25% of their usual load, so as not to risk running aground on the riverbed. This caused severe delays to shipping. ""There are lots of well-known German and Swiss blue-chip companies... that rely on inland waterways to get raw materials and products in and out,"" says Ms Sloek-Andersen. The cargo Maersk's riverboats carry ranges from temperature-sensitive fresh produce and pharmaceuticals, to raw materials like chemicals, and car and machinery parts. ""We carry our customers' cargo on barges wherever possible,"" says Ms Sloek-Andersen, ""because it means far less CO2 emissions compared to trucks."" BBC World Service - Business Daily, Why Europeâs inland shipping network is drying up However, when the Rhine's levels fell last summer, Maersk says its existing partnerships with rail providers meant they were able to ""jump in with extra capacity"". Rail, says Ms Sloek-Andersen, is the preferred alternative to river as they have a similarly low CO2 footprint, at around 20-30g of CO2 per tonne-km per year (gCO2e/tkm), as opposed to trucks that emit almost 140 gCO2e/tkm.  However, she adds that other companies had to switch to road freight. And it wasn't just Europe that found itself high and dry last year. ""You could walk across the mighty Mississippi River - that's not something we were prepared for,"" says Sarah Schiffling, a supply chain expert, and assistant professor at Hanken School of Economics, Helsinki, Finland. The Mississippi River is used to transport more than 500 million tonnes of freight a year, but last year record low water levels were estimated to have cost $20bn (Â£16.7bn) in economic damage. ""Droughts are not a new phenomenon,"" says Prof Schiffling, ""but [last year] we saw droughts in multiple areas across the world, all at the same time. It had a massive impact on inland shipping."" In China, parts of the Yangtze River, whose surrounding provinces produce 45% of the country's economic output, were closed to ships because water levels were more than 50% below average. Meanwhile, two-thirds of Europe experienced drought conditions in 2022, as the continent saw its worst dry spell in at least 500 years. It comes as studies show that drought conditions are only expected to worsen in the years ahead. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade. So what can be done to help river barges stay afloat? In Germany, one proposed solution is to deepen a shallow section of the Rhine. This would enable cargo riverboats to carry at least an extra 200 tonnes, according to Germany's Waterways and Shipping Office. But plans to deepen a 31-mile section of the World Heritage-listed Middle Rhine - where the river is lined with castles and vineyards - are controversial. ""Deepening and widening the area will have knock-on effects on the environment - flooding and destroying ecosystems,"" says Prof Schiffling. ""And, of course, it doesn't solve the core problem. No matter how deep you make it, there's just not enough water."" Rather than swapping to land transport, one designer and operator of cargo riverboats, Germany's HGK, is now introducing vessels that can continue to sail in very shallow waters. ""Our shallow-water tanker, Synthese 18, can transport cargo weighing 300 tonnes - even if the water is only 1.05 metres deep,"" says Anke Bestmann, managing director HGK Gas Shipping. The boat has a very short vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of its hull, a measurement known as a ""draft"". To compensate for this lack of depth, the vessel is wider than older barge designs. It is also made from a lighter-weight stainless steel, and the riverboat's design is said to allow for great uplift as it moves along the water. Fellow HGK director Tim Godde adds that the firm is ""convinced that inland waterway vessels will transport even more goods in future"". However, Maersk's Ms Sloek-Andersen says that the ability for a transportation firm to adapt, and switch from river to rail, and so on, is key.  ""Having a single provider for all parts of a supply chain makes it much easier and quicker to react and mitigate negative impact if disruption occurs - like a low-water period on one of the main inland waterways of Europe,"" she says.

One of the suspects is the owner of a Florida-based security company, which authorities say hired Colombian ex-soldiers for the mission. President Moise was shot and killed at his home in Port-au-Prince, reportedly by Spanish-speaking foreign mercenaries.  Eleven suspects are now in US custody. According to the Justice Department (DOJ),  Venezuelan-American Antonio ""Tony"" Intriago, who is the owner of Florida-based CTU Security, hired a squad of former Colombian soldiers for the operation. He has now been hit with a slew of charges, including conspiracy to kill or kidnap a person outside of the US.  A CTU company representative, Colombian citizen Arcangel Pretel Ortiz, has also been arrested.  A third suspect, Florida-based financier Walter Veintemilla, is accused of financing the plot to kill Mr Moise. His attorney told the Associated Press that he plans to plead not guilty. The fourth suspect - Frederick Joseph Bergmann Jr - has been accused of smuggling ballistic vests as part of the plot.  ""It is extremely important to bring (them) to justice,"" said US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Markenzy Lapointe. ""We will deliver justice in the courtroom."" US authorities had previously announced the arrest of seven men for their alleged role in the plot, including Haitian-American dual citizens James Solages and Joseph Vincent, and pastor and businessman Christian Emmanual Sanon.  Haitian police have said that Mr Sanon had ""political objectives"" to replace President Moise.  The DOJ believes that Mr Solages and Mr Vincent, along with Colombian national GermÃ¡n Alejandro Rivera, originally planned to detain the Haitian president and fly him away from Haiti so that a new president could be installed. The plan was reportedly abandoned  because they did not have an aircraft.  In a statement in January, US prosecutors said that the three men and others met at a house in Haiti just before the assassination, ""where firearms and equipment was distributed and Solages announced that the mission was to kill President Moise"". Haiti's own investigation into the assassination has largely stalled, with three judges having resigned from their posts due to security concerns. A fourth was dismissed.  More than 40 suspects have been arrested in Haiti and remain in custody, including 18 Colombians. Three others were killed immediately after President Moise's death.  Â© 2023 BBC.

The 36-year-old man was apprehended in Darwin and was due to appear in court on Thursday, police said. The trio was found clinging to an esky cool box off Western Australia (WA) on 1 February. Police say they claimed they were out fishing when their boat capsized. But authorities later discovered 365kg of cocaine in at least two locations, sparking a hunt for the men. They are suspected of involvement in an international drug shipment. The arrested man, Aristides Avlontis, faces a charge of importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said. Police are still searching for Mate Stipinovich, 49, and Karl Whitburn, 45, one of whom is the registered owner of the capsized boat. The two are believed to be in WA.  Authorities initially praised the trio when they were rescued near Eclipse Island, 17km south of Albany in WA, issuing a press release saying their case ""highlighted the importance of wearing a lifejacket and carrying an emergency beacon"". But WA police soon found inconsistencies in the trio's story and contacted the AFP who started an investigation. Six days after the men were rescued, a black plastic-wrapped package containing parcels of cocaine was found on a beach 54km (33 miles) west of Albany. And the next day an overturned cabin cruiser was discovered with eight similarly wrapped packages, each containing about 40kg of cocaine. Police believe the drugs were collected from the ocean and being ferried to shore in the boat. How the drugs were initially left in the ocean is not known. AFP Acting Commander Graeme Marshall said the seizure of the drugs would deal a ""significant blow"" to a ""well-resourced syndicate"". ""The AFP estimates this seizure has saved the community more than $235m in drug-related harm, including associated crime, healthcare and loss of productivity,"" he said. Â© 2023 BBC.

The show opened with his huge hit As It Was, which won song of the year. ""I'm aware of my privilege up here tonight,"" he said, naming women who missed out on artist of the year, including Mabel, Florence Welch, Charli XCX, Rina Sawayama and Becky Hill. Beyonce won international awards for best artist and song of the year, while Wet Leg won best group and new artist. Wet Leg's singer, Rhian Teasdale, said: ""This is so scary because being on the telly can be such a boys' club thing"" and thanked all the women who worked on their debut album, saying: ""I want to shout them out.""  She also referenced Alex Turner's Arctic Monkeys Brits acceptance speech from 2014, saying: ""That rock and roll - it just won't go away. It might hibernate from time to time and sink back into the swamp.""  Both bands share the same record label, Domino. This year's nominations saw no women up for best artist, following last year's decision by organisers to scrap their best male and best female awards in favour of gender-neutral prizes. Women who were eligible but missed out included those named by Styles in his speech. Flo, the only black British winner, won the rising star award, but did not get to perform on the night as has been the case in previous years - instead having their prize announced before the show. Styles also thanked his Mum for ""signing me up for X Factor without telling me"", along with his fellow One Direction members Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik.  Shania Twain, who performed on stage at Coachella last year with Styles, gave him his Brit for song of the year. Earlier, she told the BBC's Mark Savage that the singer's popularity stems from him being ""incredibly authentic, and people sense that"". ""He's nice, he's likeable, he's kind, he's a gentleman,"" she said. ""Obviously he's super-talented - he has everything you want as a fan to follow and appreciate and respect."" This is Harry's House and we're all just living in it. But while his success might seem preordained, it's easy to forget that reality show contestants and former boyband members are usually consigned to the great pop dumper, never to be seen again. When Harry Styles first went solo, his music was eclipsed by his bandmates - Zayn Malik and Liam Payne, in particular, scored hits that were bigger and stickier in those early, post-One Direction days. He started to find his way on his second album, Fine Line, delving into the 70s rock sounds of his childhood: Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, Paul McCartney. He added some utopian philosophy of his own (Treat People With Kindness) and scored his first million-seller with the joyous and infectious Watermelon Sugar. His third album updates that sound, adding 80s synths, and an easy-going intimacy. The scat singing and synth horns on Music For A Sushi Restaurant capture his quirky charisma; while Boyfriends' critique of toxic masculinity is the song every girl wants Harry to sing to them while he paints their toenails. Unusually for a big pop album, Styles' voice is mellow and restrained instead of belting out the hooks, Adele-style. That makes it less immediate than you might expect - but it grows beautifully, like dough in a proving oven. It ended the year as the UK's best-selling album, shifting almost half-a-million copies. With numbers like that, the commercially-minded Brit Awards were never going to turn their back on Styles. Beyonce sent video messages for her wins as she was unable to attend, saying: ""Thank you so much for loving Break my Soul - the only intention for this song was to dance."" The singer, who made history at last week's Grammys where she won her 32nd award, thanked her fans and referenced her recent album and upcoming tour, saying: ""The renaissance begins."" Styles also won three awards at the Grammys, including album of the year.  This video can not be played Watch: Lizzo brings down the house at the Brit Awards 2023 This video can not be played Watch: Wet Leg are all smiles as they collect their Brit Awards The show ran fairly smoothly, although host Mo Gilligan wrongly introduced Lewis Capaldi as ""Sam Capaldi"", who performed Forget Me.  Gilligan joked afterwards: ""I have to apologise, it just goes to show how strong the drinks are.""  At another point, the presenter said ""technical difficulties"" meant they had to play a recording of Adele singing I Drink Wine at last year's ceremony. Live performers this year included Lizzo, Cat Burns, Stormzy, Sam Smith, Ella Henderson and Becky Hill. Rapper Aitch won best hip-hop/rap/grime artist, and said: ""Not to get all cliched, but not many people where I'm from, especially my side of Manchester, get the opportunity to stand up here and receive such an amazing gift or award."" He added that he performs ""to set examples and to make people know it's possible no matter where you're from"", adding ""Respect. 0161 in the building,"" a reference to Manchester's dialling code.  Becky Hill won best dance act for the second year in a row, after performing her first US tour last year, and said it was ""such an honour"" to be nominated alongside stars including ""amazing Eliza Rose and the incredible Raye"". ""I think Beyonce said it best in her Grammy speech. We all have the queer community to thank for the best genre on earth,"" she added.  The 1975 won best alternative rock act - their fourth Brit Award - and lead singer Matty Healy said: ""This is one that has been voted for by the fans so that means a lot."" Best international group went to Irish rockers Fontaines DC, whose guitarist Carlos O'Connell said: ""My heart is full... I'm happy to be [here] to celebrate that."" Producer and French DJ David Guetta had already been announced as producer of the year, but he was presented with his award by Norman Cook, also know as Fatboy Slim.

Philip Mehrtens was kidnapped after landing his plane in Papua's remote mountainous province of Nduga. In the video sent to the BBC's Indonesian service, Mr Mehrtens was surrounded by seven West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) fighters.  They pledged to release the pilot if Papua was granted independence. Previously a Dutch colony, Papua declared independence in 1961, but Indonesia took control two years later. The resource-rich region has been caught in a battle for independence ever since it was brought under Jakarta's formal control in a UN-supervised vote in 1969. The fighters appearing in the videos were armed with a mixture of assault rifles and bows and arrows. One man - who addressed the camera and outlined the group's demands - introduced himself as TPNPB leader Egianus Kogoya.  The BBC cannot independently verify the man's identity.  Mr Mehrtens - who appeared in the video wearing a blue denim jacket, a matching hat and long khaki pants - seemingly read a prepared statement in which he repeated the rebels' demands.  The 37-year-old was kidnapped after his small passenger plane, which belongs to Indonesia's Susi Air, landed in Nduga.  His plane had departed from the Mozes Kilangin airport in Central Papua early on Tuesday, and was meant to return a few hours later after dropping off five passengers. But shortly after landing rebels stormed the single-engine plane and seized the Christchurch native. A TPNPB spokesman later told BBC Indonesian that Mr Mehrtens had been moved to a stronghold district for the group in a remote area, and he would be used as ""leverage"" in political negotiations. The group says that the pilot is being held because New Zealand co-operates militarily with Indonesia.  The other passengers, who were indigenous Papuans, were released.  Papuan rebels seeking independence from Indonesia have previously issued threats and even attacked aircraft they believe to be carrying personnel and supplies for Jakarta. Conflicts between indigenous Papuans and the Indonesian authorities are common, with pro-independence fighters mounting more frequent attacks since 2018. The region is divided into two provinces, Papua and West Papua. It is separate from Papua New Guinea, which was given independence by Australia in 1975. Â© 2023 BBC.

It is the country's biggest weather event in a century, according to Prime Minister Chris Hipkins. There have been several landslides in Muriwai, a coastal community on the north-west coast of New Zealand's North Island. They have destroyed all roads and buildings in their path. One firefighter remains missing in Muriwai after being caught in a landslide, and a second firefighter was critically injured. At one stage on Tuesday the search for the missing firefighter had to be suspended because the ground was so unstable. A resident of Muriwai walks through thick mud - the remnants of a landslide. Nearly a third of New Zealand's 5.1 million population live in the affected regions, and hundreds of thousands of houses were left without power at the peak of the storm. The Waiohiki Bridge on the Tutaekuri River is one of at least six bridges in the area that have been washed away.  Local media in nearby Hawke's Bay reported that some residents had to swim through their bedroom windows to escape the flood waters. Other bridges on the Tutaekuri River remain standing, but have been closed because of a build-up of dangerous debris. The cyclone caused the evacuation of many coastal towns, and in some the army has been brought in to support emergency services.

In Eurovision world that's sort of what fans are having to contend with, on what's been dubbed Super Saturday, as seven countries air huge TV programmes to pick a representative for the song contest in May. While there are 13 weeks until the song contest's grand final, 20-year-old Ethan Wilshaw from Plymouth will be sitting down with his parents to spin through performances from Italy, Estonia, Denmark, Malta, Latvia, Croatia and Romania. ""It's quite stressful but I think that sort of chaos and overwhelming nature is inherent to Eurovision,"" he tells BBC News. ""I don't know how I'm going to prioritise them but the good thing is the different time zones because you can dip in and out."" He first watched the national final season in 2019 and one of his favourite things he's learnt is ""how important it is for other countries"" with these finals being the biggest night on TV in parts of Europe. There are typically two ways a Eurovision entry is chosen: an internal selection - an act chosen behind-the scenes - or a national selection - a TV show with the winner getting to fly their country's flag in Liverpool. In its 73rd year, Italy's five-night iconic Festival di Sanremo, which has become essential streaming for Eurovision fans, will see a winner chosen from the 28 competing acts. There are also special guests like Black Eyed Peas, Depeche Mode and Rage Against The Machine's Tom Morello. I watched the second night on Wednesday with Italian friends who helped me with translation, told me the back story of contestants, and didn't kick me out for bringing a Hawaiian pizza (grazie). The show really is a unique event and, after pizza (and tiramisu), I still couldn't think of a comparable cultural show that unites a nation the way Sanremo does - but I ended up with a cross between the Royal Variety performance, the Super Bowl halftime show and the New Year's Eve countdown. The country's president, Sergio Mattarella, attended the opening night while other politicians and celebrities filled the seats for the rest of the week in black tie, with a huge chunk of the population watching at home, peaking at more than 16 million and a 62% share of TV viewers. MÃ¥neskin, who've just released a new album and were nominated for best new act at last week's Grammy Awards, still describe winning the festival as ""one of the top three achievements"" in their career. Speaking to BBC News, frontman Damiano David says: ""Eurovision somehow makes sense that we won because we had cool outfits, had a powerful song and were very different from all the other contestants. It makes sense in my mind. ""To win the most classical and traditional competition in Italian music... it's not what we do, it's not rock and roll music - it's soft pop or very deep song writing. It is still one of the most astonishing things that ever happened and I can't explain it."" The winner this year is tipped to be Marco Mengoni, who represented Italy at Eurovision in 2013, but he's adamant he ""just wants go on stage and feel like I'm on tour"".  ""It's a cultural event and this year the cast is amazing,"" he explains on the BBC's Eurovisioncast podcast. ""Sanremo is a reflection of Italian music, all the rainbow colours of music are represented on stage.""  Italy by far has the biggest national final on Saturday, but Estonia's Eesti Laul and Denmark's Melodi Grand Prix also command big domestic audiences, as well as fans abroad streaming them. The conversation dominates the fandom on Twitter and in WhatsApp group chats, which can be ""a chaotic mess"" for fans who live and breathe Eurovision all year. ""I will try to watch as many as I can,"" explains 22-year-old Mandy Huibregtsen from Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  ""Estonia has a super strong selection this year. My brother's girlfriend is Maltese, so she's been keeping me up to date with that. In national finals in other countries they give smaller artists a platform."" Italy's 28 acts is dwarfed by Denmark's eight artists in Dansk Melodi Grand Prix taking place in NÃ¦stved arena, about an hour outside of Copenhagen. Last year's Eurovision winners Kalush Orchestra will be the interval act. ""I wanted to have a deeper connection to my home territory"", Reiley, who lives on the Faroe Islands, a self-governing nation under the external sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark, tells the BBC just before rehearsals. ""I've done music in a bunch of different places but never in Denmark. I just love performing and any opportunity to put on an amazing show for people."" Most of his fans are in South Korea, after a previous song went viral there, but he says ""it's awesome"" fans outside of Denmark will be watching him compete on Saturday night.  This video can not be played The rundown on the 2023 contest in 50 seconds This year the BBC is using an internal selection for the United Kingdom, working with the same management company who approached Sam Ryder last year. A Eurovisioncast listener called Ben asked as these shows across Europe are so big now, if I thought the BBC would revisit that format in the future?  The success of Sam Ryder - chosen internally - and the pressure for the UK to continue its success makes me think it would be a risk but Ethan in Plymouth disagrees. ""I've actually managed to get my Mum and Dad to watch them with me and we get a takeaway,"" he laughs. ""I do think as we've found our mojo we would benefit from one. ""We've got the public interest for it now and I think the UK would be engaged with one"".  All the build-up, insights and analysis is explored each week on a new BBC podcast called Eurovisioncast.

""It's Ceyda's room.""  Before the earthquake, 19-year-old Ceyda Ocan looked through that window and those curtains, on to her street in the city of Iskenderun. Now her best friend Damla is on the street with her family to keep vigil at the fallen apartment block, hoping that Ceyda has survived, as rescue workers sift and dogs sniff for signs of life. Damla met Ceyda in the neighbourhood when she was six and Ceyda eight, and they stayed close. They bought those curtains together on a recent shopping trip.  ""We both love butterflies,"" Damla says, weeping. On her phone is a picture of a birthday cake Ceyda organised for Damla with her sister, and in purple icing with butterfly decorations it says: ""Who loves you the most in the world? Us of course!"" Ceyda's apartment block, called Orcan, sat in a row of mid-rise pink and beige buildings with small balconies, in the centre of Iskenderun, all with shops on the ground floor. When the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck at 04:17 on Monday, Ceyda would have been sleeping, along with the other residents of Orcan. The block crumpled with the force of the tremor. Many buildings in southern Turkey have been wiped out of existence this week, but this is the story of Orcan, home to Ceyda and her family alongside the residents of 14 other flats. In the days after the quake, their friends and family gathered round Orcan hoping for the best, and speaking of their loved ones. We witnessed one brief moment of elation on Wednesday when a survivor was pulled from the rubble after more than a day of digging - one of Ceyda's neighbours.  According to rescuers and residents in the area, she managed to say that she had spoken to Ceyda through the fallen walls, and that Ceyda had said she was OK. But officials warned that the survivor was disorientated - it might not have actually happened. By Friday, there was no more news.  We went back to Orcan for three days in a row to witness the informal rescue efforts, the people fleeing for safer places, and the field hospitals erected for survivors. Rescuers and neighbours all told us that they knew of three people who survived - the rest are unaccounted for. Those gathered said Orcan was home to a tight-knit community, where neighbours would frequently visit each other's homes for tea or strong Turkish coffee. Residents of Orcan and other buildings on the street had WhatsApp groups and arranged regular meet-ups. ""It was like, your place this week, yours next,"" one local man said. ""This is the Turkish way."" When asked what the neighbourhood was like, Damla's uncle Emrullah, who ran the local grocery shop, clasped his hands together. ""Like this,"" he said. Orcan has stood for decades. ""I'm 50 years old and I remember walking past it on my way to and from school,"" one man said. When the earthquake hit, locals told us the buildings on Orcan's row fell ""like dominoes"". On either side of the line of destruction, similar buildings appear unscathed and their residents spoke with both guilt and relief. Cansu, a local paramedic, knew several of the people who lived in Orcan. After the earthquake hit, she left her home and ran round the corner to the entrance of Ceyda's street, she said. The buildings along that row are now crumpled together in a mass of debris. Only a few traces of the residents inside are visible: a kite decorated with characters from the Disney film Frozen; a torn Quran; a squashed white oven; a red-rimmed clock, frozen in time. A man whose grandfather - a swimming enthusiast with a love for beer and stuffed peppers - lived in the building next door reached into the rubble beneath Ceyda's curtains and pulled out a phone.  It was still working - and the background picture was his grandfather's face. The man smiled a bittersweet smile. A mother, 63-year-old Sehvar, and her non-verbal daughter Derya lived on the first floor of the apartment block. Family members watching the rescue efforts said the pair spent most of their time together at home, Sehvar caring for her daughter. ""Even if she is alive and hears the sounds asking if anyone is out there, she will not be able to answer,"" said Derya's sister Deniz, who travelled from her home some two hours away to be at the wreckage. On the same floor, on the other side of the building, lived university graduate Berk. One man said he was often seen around the neighbourhood drinking Coca-Cola, and joked that he must have drunk litres of it every day.  Many who talked about him said he was ""intelligent"", ""sociable"" and ""handsome"". Berk's brother Dogukan said he was trapped beneath rubble at the foot of the building with his mother after the earthquake, but was rescued in the immediate aftermath. He was critical of the official rescue effort, and said he had waited under the rubble for nine hours. He said he did not want to talk about the experience more while his brother was still missing, but neighbours said he had been rescued after managing to call his other brother, who was not at home at the time of the earthquake, for help.  Berk has not been seen in days and his mother is now in hospital with injuries, apparently telling doctors: ""I cannot feel my feet and my son is trapped inside"". On the second floor lived another mother and daughter - 64-year-old Hatice and 33-year-old Derya. One family member described the pair as being like Tom and Jerry. ""Whatever one did, the other did the opposite. But they couldn't live without each other,"" the relative said. ""They are probably inches apart even now."" Mevlut - Derya's father and Hatice's ex-husband - has waited each day for news of the pair. He described his daughter as being ""beautiful"" and ""full of life"", cupping his hands around his face for emphasis. In Derya's job, he said, she was responsible for ensuring safe environments in the workplace. That meant she would know ""where to go, what to do, how to act"" in an emergency. He was staying positive and was full of faith in his daughter's capabilities, holding out hope that she would ""lead her mother and others to a safe place in the building"". Living with Ceyda on the third floor was her mother and father. Her older sister had moved away from home but was still nearby. Neighbours gathered told us that when her sister arrived at Orcan after the earthquake, she fainted and had to be carried away. Her grandparents also lived around the corner. Their building, too, was destroyed by the earthquake. Relatives describe them as a close family and the parents as the perfect couple. Ceyda's dad, Cengiz, owned a spare parts shop. Her mum had lost two of her sisters earlier in life, and family members say they worry how she will cope if she is pulled from the wreckage to learn that her parents are also now dead. Ceyda's popularity in the community is evident within minutes of arriving on the street. Friends faces light up when they recall memories of her, while both her current and ex-boyfriend join the search for her. She was described as outgoing and thoughtful, and had been working hard to get into a university in Istanbul this year to study with Damla. ""Her favourite thing is going for coffee,"" Damla says, adding that Ceyda would often take her friends out in her white Volkswagen car. The car is now parked metres from the ruined apartment building, its windshield crushed. A red lighter can be seen inside. On Friday, rescue workers called in through Ceyda's window: ""Is anyone alive there?"" before heavy machinery broke into the room, pushing those butterfly curtains into the debris. Damla says she is still determined that Ceyda will be found safe and ""will smile again"". While we stayed near the building, learning about its residents from friends and family, one survivor was pulled out. It was Ferdane, a single mother in her 50s who is well-liked in the community. She lived on the fourth floor. She was the survivor who said she had spoken to Ceyda. Rescue workers said she was injured and distressed and had been taken to hospital, where her adult son was at her bedside. When she was being taken away, she had asked how long she had been under rubble for, one worker said.  Her son replied: ""Three days mama."" She thought it had been six.  By Friday, though, rescue workers had told the families still waiting at the site that they should not expect any more survivors.  If there were, it would be a miracle, they said. UPDATE, Saturday 11 February, 03:20 local time (00:20 GMT): Ceyda's body was found shortly after this article was published, along with the bodies of her father and mother. Her family buried them immediately in Iskenderun. Additional reporting by Emrah Bulut,  Nihan Kalle and Tural Ahmedzade.

The boy, identified by family as Cairo Winitana from Sydney, was staying with his parents at the Club Wyndham Denarau Island Resort on the west coast of Fiji's main island.  Fiji police said he was found lying ""motionless"" near a flower garden at the hotel last Thursday.  He was taken to hospital in the nearby city of Nadi, but could not be revived. ""Initial information gathered is that the child was allegedly electrocuted however the post-mortem will have to confirm that,"" Fiji police said.  The boy was a New Zealand citizen but resident of Australia, they added. New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing assistance to the family, a spokeswoman said. In a Facebook post, his mother Amber de Thierry said: ""I loved you my son from the moment I found out I was carrying you and will love you forever more"". The family now faced ""the heart breaking job"" of bringing their son back to Australia, an online fundraiser set up by a relative said. ""As you could all imagine this is a very devastating loss for our family"". Cairo would be remembered as ""a shy, tough little kid who loved his footy"", the club where he played - the Milperra Colts - wrote in a tribute on Facebook.  A spokesperson for the resort described the death as a ""tragic accident"" and expressed ""heartfelt condolences"" to the family. The resort would conduct a full investigation and fully cooperate with police and local authorities, the spokesperson said. Known for its luxury resorts and hotels, Denarau Island is about 5km (3.1 miles) north-west of Nadi, Fiji's third-largest city. Â© 2023 BBC.

Figures vary, but at least 17 have been arrested, an international group for press freedom says. Another puts the number about three times that or more. Iran has been gripped by some of the biggest protests it has seen since the Islamic Republic was founded in 1979. Nearly 20,000 people are estimated to have been detained since September. More than 520 protesters have been killed by security forces in that time, according to the Iranian Human Rights Activists' News Agency (Hrana). The most recent arrest of a female journalist was that of Elnaz Mohammadi, who works for the reformist newspaper Hammihan. She was released on bail on Sunday. Ms Mohammadi is the twin sister of Elaheh Mohammadi, who works for the same newspaper and was arrested on 29 September last year. She was detained for her reporting on the funeral of Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman whose death in police custody on 16 September sparked the protests. Ms Amini had been detained for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. A week before Elnaz Mohammadi was arrested, three other female journalists - Melika Hashemi, Saideh Shafiei and Mehrnoosh Zareie - were detained within the space of 48 hours.  ""We're seeing an unusual number of female journalists being arrested because what sparked the protests was the mandatory hijab law and the death of a young woman because of gender discrimination,"" Yeganeh Rezaian, a researcher with the Washington-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), told the BBC. ""Naturally more female journalists were covering the story. Even in small towns and local newspapers women were reporting on the women-led protests that were taking place,"" she said. Indeed the first journalist to publish a photo of Mahsa Amini was Niloufar Hamedi. She was arrested on 22 September and is still behind bars. The CPJ estimates that at least 98 journalists and bloggers have been arrested, half of whom, it says, are women.  Reporters Without Borders (RSF), an international advocacy group for journalistic freedom, estimates that 55 journalists have been arrested since the start of the protests, 27 of whom are still being held with others released on bail awaiting sentencing.   RSF says 17 female journalists have been arrested since the start of the uprising, the highest number in a five-month period in the history of the Islamic Republic.  RSF's World Press Freedom Index puts Iran among the world's worst 10 countries for freedom of press.  Media in Iran are largely controlled by the state, and even so-called ""independent"" newspapers are heavily censored. Journalists inside Iran are barred from covering the protests or the funerals of protesters who have been killed. Mrs Rezaian says that is why ""many of the journalists have been arrested for their tweets and social media posts about the protests"".  On 28 January, Nazila Maroofian, the first journalist to publish online an interview with Mahsa Amini's father, tweeted that she had been sentenced to two years in prison, fined and banned from leaving the country for five years.  She said she had been convicted of ""anti-government propaganda and spreading false news"" without a hearing and in absence of a lawyer. Article 24 of Iran's constitution guarantees press freedom. But a 1986 press law, later amended to take account of online publications, allows the authorities to ensure that journalists do not ""endanger the Islamic Republic"", ""do not offend the clergy and the Supreme Leader"" and do not ""spread false information"".  It means journalists who challenge the official narrative of the state in any way can be targeted.  ""Most of the arrests happen in the middle of the night,"" says Mrs Rezaian. ""Security forces raid the homes of journalists, confiscating their [electronic] devices and the devices of their family members, mostly without showing a warrant."" Because most of the raids happen without a warrant, Mrs Rezaian says ""families often don't know which organisation is responsible for the arrests and where their loved ones are being taken"".  But based on information from the CPJ, the intelligence branch of the Revolutionary Guards is behind the arrests.  Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

141,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,Why is South Africa's navy joining exercises with Russia and China?,"South Africa is taking part in a naval exercise with Russia and China, to the dismay of the US.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-64380572,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6FD6/production/_128403682_russianfleet.png,2023-02-17T00:12:42Z,"South Africa is holding a joint military exercise with Russia and China that opposition figures say amounts to an endorsement of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The US has also criticised the 10-day naval drills, which will continue over the first anniversary of the war in Ukraine. But South Africa's government says it remains neutral regarding the conflict, and that it routinely hosts similar drills with other countries, including France and the US. The naval exercises, called Mosi, which means ""smoke"" in the Tswana language, are taking place in the Indian Ocean, off the South African coast. The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) says 350 members of its armed forces will take part. Russia has announced it will send its Admiral Gorshkov warship, which carries Zircon hypersonic missiles. These fly at nine times the speed of sound and have a range of 1,000 km (620 miles).   Moscow ""will be trying to show that despite its setbacks in the war in Ukraine, its armed forces are still very powerful"", says Denys Reva from South Africa's Institute for Security Studies. The SANDF has said little about the forthcoming exercise, but a 2019 joint drill between the three countries involved seven ships - one warship from each nation, plus fuelling ships and survey ships.  They practised tackling coastal fires and floods, and recapturing ships from pirates. A White House spokesperson said in January: ""The United States has concerns about any country... exercising with Russia as Russia wages a brutal war against Ukraine."" South Africa previously abstained from a UN vote condemning the invasion. It also refused to join the US and Europe in imposing sanctions on Russia.  The South African government sparked a political row when it gave permission for a superyacht called the Nord, which is linked to the sanctioned Russian oligarch Alexey Mordashov, to dock in Cape Town - although it is thought the vessel did not actually go there. The sanctioned Russian cargo ship, Lady R, was also allowed to unload supplies at a South African naval base. The government said it contained a delayed order for ammunition. South Africa points out it has held four joint exercises with the US since 2011, as well as drills with France and Germany. ""All countries conduct military exercises with friends worldwide,"" said Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor, during a visit to her country by her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in January. She said that trying to stop South Africa from conducting joint military exercises with the countries of its choice amounted to ""an abuse of international practice"". South Africa is also taking part because its armed forces are underfunded and overstretched, according to Elizabeth Sidiropoulos, head of the South African Institute of International Affairs.  The navy's priorities are to protect fisheries in its home waters and combat piracy in the Indian Ocean. ""It needs to team up with other nations to have the capacity to deal with things off its coast such as piracy,"" she says. South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC) also has long-standing ties with Russia.  These date back to the years of white-minority rule before 1994, says Dr Alex Vines from the Chatham House think-tank in London. ""The older leaders in the ANC still have an emotional attachment to Moscow, because it constantly supported their struggle,"" he says. ""That makes it very difficult for South Africa to turn its back on Russia over Ukraine."" Russia, China and South Africa also have modern-day ties because they are all members of the Brics alliance. The group - which also includes Brazil and India - represents some of the world's leading emerging economies. Ms Sidiropoulos says Russia has more to gain than anyone from this year's exercise.  ""It shows that Russia can still project its power far away, and that it still has allies around the world. ""It lets them say that it's not the world that's against Russia. Only the West is against Russia.""  China is keen to keep shipping lanes open for commercial vessels travelling from its ports to African destinations, says Dr Vines. It also wants to establish its naval power in the Indian Ocean, off the African coast. ""It's about getting its navy out into international waters. ""China already uses Djibouti on the East African coast as a naval base to combat piracy, and perhaps it is hoping to get more bases."" Â© 2023 BBC.

Representatives of the Norfolk Southern railway company, whose train carrying the chemicals derailed 13 days ago causing a huge fire, cited security concerns when they pulled out.  After the derailment, emergency crews performed a controlled release of vinyl chloride from five railcars that were at risk of exploding.  Thick plumes of black smoke towered over the town, East Palestine, but crews monitoring the air quality sought to reassure locals that it was going as planned.  Despite those assurances from officials, many residents say they continued to be frightened of the potential harms, which they say had impacted humans and wildlife alike.  Thousands of dead fish have appeared in the creeks in the town, while people told local media that their chickens had died suddenly, and that their pets had fallen ill.  Many have reported difficulties getting their water tested, fuelling mistrust at what they see as an ineffective and inadequate response to the crisis. Even before the event began, the company's absence left many residents seething.  ""They have something to hide. You don't back out of questions if you know how to answer them,"" East Palestine resident Jaime Cozza said. ""It was like a bomb went through our town.""  Under the banners and murals of a local high school gymnasium, hundreds of people bombarded officials with repeated - and occasionally profanity-laden - questions about air and water quality.  ""I'm just as frustrated. I live in the community, just like you,"" said East Palestine's Mayor Trent Conaway, exhaustion clearly visible on his face. ""I'm trying to get answers."" Just hours before the meeting, Norfolk Southern announced that it would not attend. In a statement, the company said it had become ""increasingly concerned about the growing physical threat"" to its employees because of the likelihood of ""outside parties"" participating.  Lifelong resident Chris Wallace - who remains unable to return to his house near a local creek - told the BBC that many townspeople had long been concerned about the speeds at which trains went through East Palestine, as well as the potential dangers of exhausted staff.  ""They should be here answering questions,"" he said. ""They've got a lot to hide. They don't want us to know anything. They bombed us.""  The BBC has reached out to Norfolk Southern for comment.  On multiple occasions, officials at the meeting were forced to plead with local residents to be civil, with Mayor Conaway telling those in attendance that ""we're all adults here"". Mr Wallace and Ms Cozza said they are banding together with other locals to bring in outside experts to examine soil and water and bring in an attorney to answer legal questions.  Inside the crowded gymnasium, officials - including US Congressman Bill Johnson - faced repeated questions about what many locals said they see as contradictory and confusing health guidance.  ""They kept saying it's fine to drink the water, but also to drink bottled water,"" said Scott McLear. ""That's not an answer. That's a contradiction, live for everyone to see.""  In the days after the crash, some residents said they experienced headaches and nausea. After monitoring the air quality, the Environmental Protection Agency said earlier in the week that it had not detected harmful levels of contaminants. It has also been monitoring the air inside hundreds of homes and said it found no chemicals. While officials at the event acknowledged that the toxins from the derailment had been deadly to wildlife - particularly fish - the head of Ohio's Health Department, Bruce Vanderhoff, told the crowd that the concentrations of toxins in the air and in water supplies were far below that which could harm humans.  ""Why are people getting sick if there's nothing in the air or the water?,"" asked a woman from the bleachers, sparking applause throughout the gymnasium.  Congressman Johnson, for his part, provided what he termed a ""common sense"" perspective.  ""I'm not a doctor, and I'm not a chemist,"" he said. ""If you've got ailments and conditions that you did not have before 3 February, go to your doctor. Get that documented."" On Thursday, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Michael Regan, is expected to travel to East Palestine to meet with local officials and assess the response to the derailment. In a statement, the EPA said that he would discuss the agency's ""air monitoring and work to ensure the health and safety of the community.""  But for some local residents, Mr Regan's visit is too little, too late.  ""I have absolutely no faith whatsoever,"" said a young man who asked only to be identified as Owen. ""The answers they are giving could be true. But they aren't delivering them in a way that's going to make anybody feel better.""  What questions do you have about the derailment and spill?

The collection of letters document Diana's feelings in the last two years of her life. The letters were written to two of her closest friends, Susie and Tarek Kassem, who treasured them for more than 25 years. One letter, in which Diana wrote about being worried her phone line was bugged, sold for Â£23,000. In this letter, dated 20 May 1996, Diana also wrote: ""If I had known a year ago what I'd experience going through this divorce, I'd never have consented - it's desperate and ugly."" The letters - which span a 20-month period from the last days of summer 1995 to the spring of 1997 - were auctioned by Lay's Auctioneers in Penzance. The auctioneers said some of the letters touched on ""the enormous stress she was experiencing during periods of very public heartbreak"", adding that despite this, her ""strength of character and her generous and witty disposition"" shone through. In a letter dated 23 April 1996, Diana apologised for cancelling a trip to the opera to see Tosca with her friends. The letter sold for Â£12,500. The letter, written on her personal cream and burgundy Kensington Palace notepaper, reads: ""I am having a very difficult time and the pressure is serious and coming from all sides. ""It's too difficult sometimes to keep one's head up and today I'm on my knees and just longing for this divorce to go through as the possible cost is tremendous. Lots of love, Diana."" A Lay's Auctioneers spokesman said it was extremely unusual for letters like these with such personal content to come up for sale. ""She was someone who was very open and very loving to her friends and it shines through in her letters, particularly to people she was obviously very fond of and close to,"" he said. ""It gives a lovely insight into the woman and she obviously was a very special loving person."" The proceeds from the sale will go to support charities that were close to the hearts of both Susie and Diana. Diana described her friendship with Mrs Kassem, who was 15 years older, like that of an older sister with whom she shared various interests. In another note she wrote: ""I am lost for words for all the lovely things you bring into my life, when many people would have deserted this ship!"" Diana was divorced in August 1996 after 15 years of marriage. At Christmas in 1996, the Princess wrote about how she was not a lover of Christmas, adding, ""I will top myself if I remain here"". She said: ""I hope that '97 will be an easier year for us all.""  That letter sold for the largest sum - Â£26,000 - considerably more than the pre-sale estimate of between Â£3,000 and Â£6,000. Princess Diana died eight months later in the car crash in Paris. The 32 cards and letters were expected to sell for Â£90,000 but sold for a total hammer price of Â£145,550.

The report summarises a two-year grand jury probe into their conduct after Mr Trump narrowly lost the state in 2020.  It says the grand jury believes some witnesses - who weren't named - committed perjury by lying under oath on the stand.  Mr Trump was never asked to testify.  But dozens of witnesses, including several prominent Republicans, were interviewed by the special grand jury. Much of the brief report - pages two through to seven - remains hidden from the public. Only its introduction, conclusion and a section detailing perjury concerns were unsealed on Thursday. The latter section states: ""A majority of the Grand Jury believes that perjury may have been committed by one or more of the witnesses testifying before it."" The unsealed portions of the report do not reveal which witnesses may have lied under oath. The 26-member panel also rejected false claims from Mr Trump that the election had been rigged, saying it found ""by a unanimous vote that no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning that election"".Â  The grand jury cannot issue indictments itself, but it can recommend that the county's district attorney Fani Willis - whose office launched the investigation - bring charges. Ms Willis, a Democrat, has promised to have a decision soon. If charges are filed, it is at that point that the public will learn more about the evidence the prosecution has to support its case. To date, no formal charges have been brought against Mr Trump or any of his associates, and no former president has been indicted in US history. Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday that the unsealed portions of the report ""have nothing to do with the President because President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong"". He pledged to ""always keep fighting for true and honest elections"". Mr Trump lost to Joe Biden by 11,779 votes in the state of Georgia in 2020.  The grand jury probe into his post-election conduct was sparked by an hour-long phone call in January 2021 between Mr Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, during which the then-president asked Mr Raffensperger to ""find"" the exact number of votes he needed to flip the results in his favour. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""I just want to find 11,780 votes"" The investigation expanded over time to include false claims of election fraud made to state lawmakers, as well as a scheme to send an alternate slate of Republican electors who met at the Georgia Capitol and signed statements falsely claiming Mr Trump had won that state.  Mr Trump - who continues to deny the 2020 presidential election results - has called the probe a ""political witch hunt"" and maintained his call with Mr Raffensperger was ""perfect"".  The grand jury interviewed 75 witnesses before it was dissolved last month, including Mr Trump's former personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham.  After parts of the report were unsealed, Mr Graham told CNN he was confident in the testimony he gave and said he hadn't heard from the district attorney's office since appearing before the jury. The grand jury probe was carried out while US lawmakers were also probing Mr Trump and his allies' attempts to overturn the election.  A select US House of Representatives committee published a more than 800-page report last year concluding that Mr Trump had incited the 6 January 2021 riot, when his supporters stormed the Capitol as lawmakers met to formalise Mr Biden's victory.

It passed with 191 votes in favour and 60 against, the final step in an extensive debate. The process to change gender on documents could in theory now take around three to four months. Another law passed on Thursday includes paid menstrual leave for women suffering severe period pain. Previously, people needed a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria and to have been on hormonal treatment for two years to change their gender on their ID card.  Now, they can identify as another gender and confirm it three months later. Those aged 12 to 13 will need a judge's approval while people aged 14 and 15 will need parental permission.  Before the vote, equality minister Irene Montero told lawmakers that ""trans people are not sick people, they are just people"". She was pictured smiling outside congress after the law was passed, bringing a 20-month-long parliamentary debate to a close.  But the law was not universally welcomed. One protester, Patricia Bilbao, said: ""We are here to support the rights of women as they are completely erasing us with these misogynist laws."" In 2014, Denmark was the first European country to pass a similar law, and is one of nine countries in the continent that have adopted self-declaration systems. Sweden, which in 1972 was the first to make gender transition legal at all, has recently restricted hormone treatment and mastectomies to those over 18. In January, Scotland's gender reform bill, passed by the Scottish government, was blocked by Westminster who said it could have a ""serious adverse impact"" on existing laws in the UK.  On Thursday, Spain also became the first country in Europe to pass legislation giving women paid menstrual leave, something Ms Montero added was a legislature ""of feminist conquests."" The law means the state will pay sick leave for women suffering severe period pain, if they have a doctor's note. It has been met with resistance, with the UGT trade union concerned that employers will favour hiring men.  Also, abortion access was increased in public hospitals and minors can now undergo the procedure without parental permission at ages 16 and 17. Menstrual and contraceptive products will also be freely distributed throughout high schools.   Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Francisco Barajah, founder of the Santa Trindade Evangelical Church, died at a hospital in the city of Beira, where he was evacuated in critical condition. After 25 days without food or water, he had lost weight to the point where he could not stand up. He was aged 39. He had been taken to hospital at the insistence of relatives and followers. Mr Barajah was diagnosed with acute anaemia and failure of his digestive organs. He was rehydrated with serums and an attempt was made to introduce liquid foods, but it was too late and and he died on Wednesday. The pastor was also a French teacher in the town of Messica in the central province of Manica, bordering Zimbabwe.  Members of the Santa Trindade Church said it was common for the pastor and his followers to fast, but not for that long. His brother Marques Manuel Barajah said the pastor had fasted, but he challenged the medical diagnosis about his death. ""The truth is that my brother suffered from low blood pressure,"" he said.  It is not the first report of such a deadly attempt to imitate Christ's 40-day fast in the desert as described in the Gospel of Matthew.  In 2015, a Zimbabwean man died after 30 days, local media said. In 2006, a British coroner found that a woman died half-way through a similar fast in London. Â© 2023 BBC.

Lawyers for the woman in the US say a ""cease-and-desist"" letter was sent by a US law firm in December, on behalf of Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan. The letter threatened to sue the woman and her parents for $300m (Â£249m) if she did not retract her statements. A lawyer for the Tates said they were pursuing valid claims for defamation. The BBC has seen a redacted copy of the letter, apparently sent on behalf of the brothers. ""In April 2022,"" it reads, ""you falsely stated to a third party that our Client human trafficked you, abused you and held you against your will [â¦] You have repeated false and defamatory statements to the police, the media, and another United States citizen about the Tate brothers."" Andrew and Tristan Tate are currently being held in preventative custody in Romania, while police investigate allegations of trafficking and rape, which both men deny. Benjamin Bull - who works for the National Centre on Sexual Exploitation - says his client is a key witness in the Romanian investigation, and that the letter was designed to do ""one thing and one thing only"": ""[It] was intended to shut down the witness; stop the witness from bringing testimony forward in any proceedings,"" he said.  ""They want these young ladies to climb into a hole and hide, never come forward [or] describe what they saw and what happened to them. It's clearly an effort to intimidate."" Lawyers for the Tates have confirmed to the BBC that the cease-and-desist letter was sent in December, as a civil matter for defamation and slander in the US, but deny any intimidation. Tina Glandian, one of their legal advisors, said there was nothing abnormal in them pursuing valid legal claims for defamation. ""The fact that [the Tates] are incarcerated right now is not a basis for them not to pursue their legal rights,"" she said. The investigation into rape and trafficking allegations is believed to rest, at least partly, on the testimony of six women.  No charges have yet been brought. The Tates' legal team have also revealed that the brothers filed criminal complaints in Romania last April against two women, including the witness who received the cease-and-desist letter in December. Ms Glandian said the criminal complaints in April were filed in response to allegations that two women were being held against their will by the Tate brothers.  ""There was no evidence whatsoever of that,"" she said, ""which is why [the Tates] were not arrested in April.  [At that time], they were nothing but victims of false allegations, and they had every right to file criminal complaints for having their homes raided [and] property seized."" The results of those criminal complaints are still pending, she says. Benjamin Bull, who represents some of the witnesses in the current Tate investigation, says the impact of legal action on his clients has been upsetting and intimidating. But Dani Pinter, part of the same legal team, says it is not just the threat of legal action that is intimidating, but the online harassment many of her clients receive for speaking out. ""Regular, high production value videos, meant to embarrass and harass them, are shared among Tate's followers,"" she told me.  ""Making really salacious claims, attempting to slut shame them, saying they're liars. But included in that is their private information - where they work, who their family members are - with the clear intention to incite harassment.  And it's working."" The two alleged victims she represents have been getting death threats, she says.  ""They're scared to death. They're both in hiding. They feel they can't settle anywhere, because people are trying to find them."" Prosecutors have been careful to keep the names of the six women in their case strictly confidential. But some have had their full names published on social media.  And the names of two witnesses even appeared in a statement to the BBC from the Tates' US communications team. The BBC is not naming them publicly. Andrew Tate and his brother have no access to their social media while in custody, but they've built a vast and loyal network of fans and supporters who are very active online. Some accounts appear to be fully-staffed operations, regularly releasing videos and documents designed to undermine the testimony of witnesses and other women making allegations against the Tates. Earlier this week, one of the most active accounts published the full name, social media handles and WhatsApp messages of one of the alleged victims in the investigation. The BBC has approached the account for comment, but has not yet received a response. Even those who barely break the surface of this story can find themselves a target. Daria Gusa spoke to the BBC and others about receiving a private message from Andrew Tate's Instagram account when she was 16 years old.  It followed the same pattern laid out by him in online speeches about how to win a woman's attention and gain influence over her. She did not allege that he had committed any crime. ""I got a bunch of messages,"" she told me. ""Most were from people saying I was lying or calling me a slut."" But she also received ""10 to 15 threats"" online. ""I had a guy texting me, telling me 'I know you're studying at this university, the schedule is published online, I know where you are'"" Daria said. Several of her friends, who also appear to have had contact with him, have refused to speak out about their experiences, she says. ""It's not just the people who work for him,"" she explained. ""It's that there are basically millions of men out there who really idolise these people, and would do anything to protect them and their image, so I think it's completely justifiable that so many girls don't want to speak out."" It is not clear exactly who runs some of the most active accounts defending the Tates, or how much cooperation exists between them. But the risks for women making public allegations against Andrew Tate can be high, and they can come from many directions. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

It flew over 900km (560 miles) for 67 minutes and landed in the Sea of Japan. Pyongyang said the test showed it was capable of countering hostile forces like the US and South Korea. It comes ahead of joint exercises between Washington and Seoul next month, designed to help fend off North Korea's increasing nuclear threats. Authorities in Pyongyang have threatened to unleash an ""unprecedently strong"" retaliation to any such drills - which it insists are being done in preparation to invade North Korea. This was reinforced early on Sunday by Kim Yo-jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who said any hostile acts would be met with a ""strong and overwhelming"" response. She also urged the US to end what she called ""threats"" against the regime.  But she added that the South Korean capital, Seoul, would not be targeted by North Korean missiles. On Friday, North Korea showed off its massive military might in a parade that included more than a dozen ICBMs. Saturday's missile, which is the first to be launched since new year's day, splashed down west of Hokkaido, in Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) at 18:27 (09:27 GMT), Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said. An EEZ is an area of the sea that a country has jurisdiction over. Japan's is a 200-nautical mile area off its coast. It reached an altitude of 5,700km (3,510 miles), government spokesperson Hirokazu Matsuno said in Tokyo. While that is incredibly high - the edge of space is about 100km - it is not the highest a North Korean missile has flown. In November, an ICBM reached an altitude of 6,100km. Previously, in January 2022, North Korea released extraordinary photos of the Earth that it claimed were taken from a missile launch that reached 2,000km. ICBMs are particularly worrying because of their long range, including mainland United States.   Japan's Defence Minister Hamada Yasukazu said Saturday's missile would have been able to do this, with a possible range of 14,000km. ""This series of actions by North Korea threatens the peace and stability of Japan and the international community, and is absolutely unforgivable,"" Mr Matsuno said.  North Korea's ""reckless behaviour"" was condemned by the G7 foreign ministers, who are attending a summit in Germany. In a statement, they said it ""threatens regional and international peace and security"" and the UN Security Council needed to take more significant measures against Pyongyang. South Korea's military reported the missile was launched from the Sunan district, north of Pyongyang, where the international airport is located. It is also where North Korea has launched most of its recent ICBM tests. North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes are banned by the UN Security Council. But this has not stopped Pyongyang from continuing with its weapons development, and holding elaborate military parades to show them off. Just over a week ago, Pyongyang showed off its largest display ever of intercontinental ballistic missiles in a midnight military parade which was attended by leader Kim Jong-un. Â© 2023 BBC.

You're experiencing all the emotions - rage, grief, sadness and tears.  Coping strategies? You might binge a show, binge fast food, or unload your emotions into your private diary. Or, if you're a world-famous musician, you might decide to record a scorching diss track taking aim at your ex. Then, upload it to the internet, stand back and watch the sparks fly. At least, that's what Shakira did with Out of Your League, her song about footballer ex Gerard PiquÃ© which has broken YouTube records. And she's not alone. Fans are convinced Flowers, by Miley Cyrus, is about her ex Liam Hemsworth. Not that pop superstars turning their raw emotions into songs is a new thing. Just ask Adele or Taylor Swift - both queens of the break-up ballad. Or Ariana Grande, The Weeknd and Justin Bieber - just some of the big names thought to have released heartbreak-inspired hits. But what's the trick to recording the perfect break-up song? And why are they so satisfying to listen to? The main reason for the genre's popularity is probably obvious: most of us get dumped (or do the dumping) at some point in our life.  It hurts. We can relate. That's according to songwriting lecturer and course leader Martin Wright, from the BIMM Institute Birmingham. He says the best break-up songs are all about the narrative. So what's the story? ""If it's me breaking up with you, it's about empowerment, liberation and freedom,"" says Martin.  ""But if it's you breaking up with me, it might be about sadness, bitterness and even sometimes revenge.""  In Out of Your League, Shakira impressively manages to combine most of these elements into a single line: ""I won't get back with you, not if you cry, not even if you beg."" Then there's the next ingredient - why the breakup is happening. ""Is it lovers scorned, or could it be something along the lines of life moving on and falling out of love?"" asks Martin. ""And then we look at what's happening now in a break-up song. So how does a person feel about their breakup?"" There are a few options here. A popular approach is the ""I'm so over this"", as demonstrated by Ariana Grande: ""I've learned from the pain/I turned out amazing."" Or you could take a leaf out of Olivia Rodrigo's songbook and her more reflective take: ""And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone."" And for the finishing touch, no good story is complete without an ending - what happens next?  Martin says the chorus and looking to the future is the key here. You could strike a hopeful note, like Adele:  ""Never mind, I'll find someone like you"". Or take the BeyoncÃ© route: ""Baby I won't shed a tear for you/I won't lose a wink of sleep/'Cause the truth of the matter/Is replacing you is so easy."" Or follow Taylor Swift's decisiveness: ""But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together. Like, ever.""  As well as being good to listen to, a break-up song can be helpful for the people writing them. Singer-songwriter Nahli, from London, says she starts writing ""in the raw state"" straight after a break-up. ""It's like you just have this lump in your throat, a heavy, horrible feeling and you feel sick,"" she says. Nahli, who has performed with the likes of Sigma, says she used to write her emotions down in her diary. Now she turns those journal entries into songs. ""When you've written them down in the moment, when you're crying into the page, and the tears are dripping down and smudging the ink... ""That's when all of my deepest emotions are coming out.""  Nahli's song Mama's Boy, on her album Therapy [Side A] is about a ""really tricky breakup"". ""This was more of a revenge [track]. I was irritated when I was writing the song,"" she says. ""I say some stuff in there that's so rude. Because in the moment, that's how I felt, I was so angry. ""And the only way that I could get those angry emotions out is because I wanted him to hear it."" Another song called Relapse on the same album is about ""knowing that person was not very good for me"". ""Sometimes, when they creep back into your life, I was so scared to relapse if I said yes."" For Nahli, the songs are a ""way of cleansing"" - the only way ""to demystify my emotions and get them out"". ""When I'm writing, I'm dismantling and pulling apart all these knots, and having them straightened out in front of me so that I can organise and process those emotions.  ""Because once you can offload, it does feel like therapy."" Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here. Â© 2023 BBC.

He helped set up two major bands in the 1960s: The Byrds, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. He was renowned for his guitar-playing and vocal harmonies. His career saw him achieve the rare feat of being inducted to the revered Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice.  Former bandmates saluted Crosby's creative talents, while acknowledging the conflicts they had endured. Crosby's wife told showbiz site Variety that he died ""after a long illness"" while surrounded by family. ""His legacy will continue to live on through his legendary music,"" her statement added. Crosby was born in California on 14 August 1941, the son of Oscar-winning Hollywood cinematographer Floyd Crosby.  He joined The Byrds in 1964 - a folk-rock group who scored their first hit with a cover of Bob Dylan's Tambourine Man, and whose other singles like Turn! Turn! Turn! and Eight Miles High helped change the face of American pop and rock. His tempestuous tenure - a period during which he also briefly dated singer Joni Mitchell - culminated in his being fired from the group three years later. Crosby then formed a supergroup with Buffalo Springfield's Stephen Stills and The Hollies' Graham Nash, who were later joined by another Buffalo Springfield star, Neil Young.  Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young made one of their first appearances at the Woodstock in 1969, and later had a hit with Mitchell's song about the legendary festival. This band, too, was beset by in-fighting and broke up after a few years - although they have periodically reformed for concerts since. Hits written by Crosby during his time in the band included the hippy anthems Almost Cut My Hair and Deja Vu, and he responded to the 1968 assassination of Robert Kennedy with the song Long Time Gone. He became known for his countercultural politics and trademark moustache as well as his musicianship. A six-decade career culminated in his final album, For Free, released in 2021.  The record saw him team up with one of his children, James Raymond, who had been put up for adoption soon after birth and only became acquainted with his father three decades later.  Off-stage, Crosby had multiple run-ins with US law enforcement, including an arrest in 1982 on drug and weapons charges. His substance abuse had reportedly intensified after the death of a girlfriend in a car crash when he was a young man. There followed periods of ill health, and a liver transplant in 1994. Crosby's reputation for a hedonistic lifestyle saw him named two decades later as ""rock's unlikeliest survivor"" by Rolling Stone magazine. Crosby later expressed regret over his addictions and altercations with co-stars, telling the Los Angeles Times in 2019 he was ""ashamed"" of some of his past behaviours. Following the musician's death, former bandmate Nash expressed his ""profound sadness"" despite the two men's often ""volatile"" relationship, adding that Crosby left behind a ""tremendous void"". ""What has always mattered to David and me more than anything was the pure joy of the music we created together, the sound we discovered with one another, and the deep friendship we shared over all these many long years,"" Nash wrote. ""David was fearless in life and in music."" Stills agreed, writing that his late collaborator was ""without question a giant of a musician"", even though they had ""butted heads a lot of the time"". ""His harmonic sensibilities were nothing short of genius,"" he added. Another tribute came from Beach Boys singer Brian Wilson, who wrote on Twitter that he was ""heartbroken"" at the news - as his fellow star had been an ""unbelievable talent"" and a ""wonderful person"". Crosby helped fellow singer Melissa Etheridge and her partner have two children by acting as their sperm donor through artificial insemination. Etheridge wrote on Thursday: ""He gave me the gift of family. I will forever be grateful to him, Django, and Jan. ""His music and legacy will inspire many generations to come. A true treasure."" Crosby, Etheridge and their respective partners revealed his involvement through an appearance together with the two young children on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine in 2000. Asked why she chose Crosby, Etheridge told the magazine: ""He's musical, which means a lot to me, and I admire his work."" In 2016, she said she had considered Brad Pitt, a good friend, as the donor, but decided against it because of the actor's desire to have a family of his own. ""I looked and I saw how badly he wanted children and I thought, I don't want to share this with someone who really, badly wants children because my children don't need another parent - they have two,"" she told Australia's Studio 10. Etheridge's family saw Crosby ""every once in a while"", she said, but Crosby and his wife Jan ""totally understood that we are the parents"". One of the children they conceived, Beckett Cypher, died in 2020 at the age of 21. Etheridge tweeted at the time that she ""joined the hundreds of thousands of families who have lost loved ones to opioid addiction"". Crosby said in 2021 that Beckett's death was ""hugely painful"". He told The Telegraph: ""It's never gonna get easy. You lose somebody you love and it hurts, that's how it is."" Etheridge told The Guardian later that year that Crosby blamed himself for Beckett's addiction, thinking it might be genetic. ""But he can't. Everybody has choices. You can't just say: 'Oh, that's David Crosby's son, soâ¦' That doesn't work at all."" Crosby and his wife also helped actress Drew Barrymore by letting her stay with them for three months as part of her programme of recovery from alcohol and drug abuse when she was 14 in 1989. ""I'm an old Hollywood kid, and I knew her story,"" Crosby said at the time. ""I felt she had been dealt a short deck, you know, a fifth-generation alcoholic, and I didn't want to see her go down the tubes."" Following Crosby's death, other famous fans paid tribute on social media. Tweets were sent from Crosby's own account the day before his death was announced - with one stating that Eleanor Rigby was his favourite Beatles to song to play on a rainy day. The exact cause of his death was not immediately specified. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

However, he had not long been a member of the Ukrainian government. He became the country's interior minister in July 2021, just six months before Russia invaded the country. Born in the western city of Khmelnytsky in 1980, he initially pursued a legal career in private practice, but entered politics in 2014. Recruited as a legal expert, he was part of the team behind Volodymyr Zelensky's successful longshot bid for the presidency in 2019. As a member of the president's Servant of the People party, he was elected to the parliament that same year and swiftly assumed a prominent role as head of the parliamentary committee on law enforcement affairs. But his move to front-bench politics came in the wake of the sudden and unexpected resignation of the previous interior minister, Arsen Avakov, a political heavyweight who had held the post under four different administrations. There had been rumours that Mr Zelensky was preparing to fire Mr Avakov, who was seen as standing in the way of the president's attempts to tackle corruption. At the time, the appointment of Mr Monastyrsky was interpreted as consolidating the president's grip on power. As interior minister, Mr Monastyrsky was responsible for the police and security inside Ukraine. When Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he rose to the challenge of rallying international support for Kyiv's fightback. He gave interviews to the world's press warning of a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" and highlighting the challenges faced by Ukraine's emergency services, which also come under the interior ministry's control. He also played a key role in updating the Ukrainian public on casualties caused by Russian missile strikes. His friend and MP Mariia Mezentseva said it was ""a tragedy for everyone"" as Mr Monastyrsky's ministry was playing a key role in Ukraine's response to the invasion. ""He responded 24/7 to his colleagues, friends and family. He was very close to President Zelensky from day one of his presidential campaign,"" she told the BBC. ""We will always remember him as a very bright, smiley, friendly, patriotic person and a civil servant of Ukraine,"" she added. ""I have no words.  I'm trying to keep calm but this is very hard, this is very hard because this is a tragedy for everyone."" Also killed in the same helicopter crash was Mr Monastyrsky's deputy, Yevgeny Enin, a former intelligence officer and top lawyer who had been in his post since September 2021. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba hailed the men as ""true Ukrainian patriots"" and said their deaths were a ""huge loss for us all"".  Â© 2023 BBC.

Nigerians currently have many major issues to contend with, such as mysterious fuel scarcities, ubiquitous insecurity and imminent presidential elections. Nevertheless, heartfelt conversations about Prince Harry and his wife Meghan following their Netflix documentary and the publication of Spare, the memoir of the UK monarch's youngest son, are ongoing even in our mothers' and aunts' WhatsApp groups - the ultimate sign of a topic's popularity in the country. While there may be many Nigerians who have watched the documentary and read the book, I do not know of any. Yet the stream of headlines has been widely discussed in this former British colony. My mother, who rarely reads any British newspapers, seems to have more details of the saga than I do - and plenty of other alleged insider information. Nigerian WhatsApp groups are a notorious breeding ground for fake and outlandish news. From the headlines we have seen so far, Africa has come up a number of times in Harry's and Meghan's stories. The couple talked lovingly to Netflix about their Zimbabwean nanny and how they allowed her to carry their son Archie on her back, tying him with a cloth, which is commonplace in many African countries. Harry revealed in the documentary that they had wanted to move to South Africa but scrapped that plan after it was leaked to the media. The prince has been particularly involved in Lesotho, which is surrounded by South Africa and where he first went as a 19-year-old and continued to visit regularly - becoming friends with Prince Seeiso. Together they set up a charity in 2006 to help vulnerable children, especially those affected by the HIV epidemic. ""Lesotho gave me the space and the freedom to breathe, to live and to grow. I've got a second family out there and a group of friends that literally brought me up,"" he told Netflix. In his book he also described a later dispute with his older brother William over who should own the Africa charity brief. They are both passionate about nature conservation on the continent and Prince William is patron of the wildlife charity Tusk Trust. ""Africa is my thing, you can't have it,"" Harry says William told him in what could be considered a modern-day scramble for Africa. Yet neither this sibling rivalry nor other mentions of the continent seem to have garnered as much interest amongst Nigerians as Harry's description in Spare of an incident in 1999 with a leopard in Botswana, which he interpreted as a message from his mother, the late Princess Diana. He took a step towards the leopard, which had come into their safari camp one evening, until some aides grabbed him away. ""I thought of my mother. That leopard was, without a doubt, a signal sent by her,"" Harry wrote. He separately described consulting a medium, who also gave him a message from his mother.  ""You're living the life she couldn't. You're living the life she wanted for you,"" the unnamed woman told him. However, the narrative going viral in Nigeria seems to have conflated the two incidents, giving the impression that Harry consulted a medium in Africa. This fake news story has generated quite a bit of amusement here, based on the stereotype of Africa and our penchant for the supernatural. Nigeria's hugely successful movie industry, known as Nollywood, often produces films featuring people consulting traditional priests who claim the ability to see into the past, future and the world of the dead.  But while the drama has been a source of intrigue and comedy, many Nigerians find the entire situation heart-breaking, and continue to express hope of a royal family reconciliation.  Nigerian cultures differ and individuals do not all share the same thoughts and attitudes, but we are generally a family-focused people. Family bonds are one of our core values. Many of us have parents from polygamous homes, and vast extended families, where drama is rarely lacking. The Nigerian way to deal with this is to call a family forum - with the presence of many relatives - to resolve the major conflicts that arise. All sides are invited to present their case and air their grievances in the presence of respected family members, including supporters of each opposing party. The atmosphere can get heated, fingers pointed in faces and punches attempted or thrown. Family members present are usually on standby to ensure that these bust-ups do not get out of hand. Growing up, I watched my father mediate over family issues in his role as the first son of his late father, who had three wives and more than 20 children. In more recent years when my father became the oldest member and therefore head of the entire Nwaubani clan, I have watched his role of mediator expand to cover more families, in disputes from those between siblings or cousins, to couples or in-laws. By the time each party has said their say to their fill, it often becomes clear that recollections really can vary, as well as perspectives and interpretations.  You could go into one of these meetings convinced that a woman is a selfish spendthrift, and come out convinced instead that her husband is a tight-fisted tyrant.  Even if a resolution satisfactory to both parties is not reached, everyone at least goes away fully aware of the intricacies of the issue - and not from a third party, like the media. Perhaps this kind of African family meeting could help the British monarchy at this difficult time?

He was first elected to parliament in 2008 and was appointed minister for Covid-19 in November 2020.  In Ms Ardern's shock announcement on Thursday she said she did not have ""enough in the tank"" to lead. How long Mr Hipkins will be in office is uncertain as New Zealand holds a general election in October. Mr Hipkins, 44, is currently minister for police, education and public service. He will still need to be formally endorsed by the Labour Party in the House of Representatives on Sunday before he can become leader.  Should he receive that backing, Ms Ardern will formally tender her resignation to the governor-general, who will then - on behalf of King Charles III - appoint Mr Hipkins as prime minister. But the incoming Labour leader faces an uphill battle if he wants to remain in the top job after the 2023 election. Inflation and increasing social inequality saw Ms Ardern's popularity fall to all-time lows according to opinion polls.  They also suggested public approval of the country's Labour Party was similarly low. Mr Hipkins' appointment removes the immediate possibility of Justice Minister Kiri Allan becoming the country's first Maori prime minister. This video can not be played Jacinda Ardern resigns: âI no longer have enough in the tankâ During her resignation announcement, Ms Ardern - who at 37 became the youngest female head of government in the world when she took office in 2017 - said the past five-and-a-half years had been the ""most fulfilling"" of her life. However, she added that leading the country during ""crisis"" had been difficult - with the Covid pandemic, Christchurch mosque shootings and White Island volcanic eruption taking place during her premiership. Reaction to Ms Ardern's announcement was mixed, with some suggesting she was ""running away before getting thrown out"". But renowned New Zealand actor Sam Neill said she had faced ""disgraceful"" treatment from ""bullies"" and ""misogynists"". If Labour loses the general election Mr Hipkins will have only spent eight months as the nation's leader - although the shortest prime ministerial stint was Harry Atkinson's term in 1884, which lasted just eight days.

157,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,Ukraine war: The 'constant risk' for ministers travelling by helicopter,The death of senior officials in a crash near Kyiv is a reminder of the dangers of helicopter travel.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64358577,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/81C1/production/_128371233_df1cd03e6130252774f585ad162cef82a1b36e6d0_155_5319_29921000x563.jpg,2023-01-21T13:11:02Z,"Even by the standards of Russia's brutal invasion, this has been a bruising week for Ukraine. A devastating missile strike in Dnipro where 46 people died was followed by a helicopter crash near Kyiv, which killed 14. The crash claimed the lives of three senior officials, including Ukraine's Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky, who was travelling towards the front line. He was making a journey ministers frequently take, in a conflict where they've tried to be as visible as possible. So, are these journeys - in which ministers fly low to the ground to avoid detection - worth the risk?  ""There are risks, but it's important to inspire our fighters, feel the situation on the front line and make decisions first-hand,"" says Volodymyr Fesenko, a political expert from Ukraine's Centre for political studies. Because the Interior Ministry is responsible for the National Guard, emergency services and the police force, Mr Fesenko believes the risks for Denys Monastyrsky were higher than for other ministers.  ""It's impossible to assess and forecast everything in advance. For those who travel by helicopter the risk exists, especially during the war,"" he says. The cause of the crash in Brovary still isn't known.  Helicopter is often the method of choice for senior figures to travel around Europe's biggest country. ""When the officials move faster, they can do more,"" points out Anton Herashchenko, a former MP who was an advisor to interior minister. Monastyrsky used to be his assistant and consultant. ""You wouldn't travel to the US by ship, would you?"" Herashchenko says. We experienced helicopter travel ourselves when we joined a trip with Monastyrsky's Interior Ministry last summer, from Kyiv to the city of Zaporizhzhia. At times it did feel like we were on a ship on choppy water - only the sea had been replaced with the green vastness of Ukraine. There'd be the occasional feeling of free fall as the helicopter vaulted over electricity pylons. For the entire trip we travelled at tree-level. There were moments where it felt like we were going to scrape someone's roof. The reason for our altitude? To avoid being detected by Russian forces. ""Because their life is important for the defence of their country, they have some level of protection,"" explains Mr Herashchenko.  ""But no one is protected against a missile, like the one which hit the residential block in Dnipro"". At the other end of our journey, Denys Monastyrsky assessed troops taking part in drills in case of a radioactive leak. The nearby nuclear powerplant in the city of Enerhodar has long been under Russian control. He then took questions from journalists, before heading back to Kyiv. A 700-mile round trip.  I have seen Mr Monastyrsky make several public appearances since Russia's full-scale invasion. I remember his convoy suddenly pulling over in Kyiv's Independence Square on 28 February. At the time it was feared Russia could be in the city at any moment, but it didn't stop him from holding a short notice press conference.  ""Police officers, border guards and emergency workers are doing all they can to bring victory closer and faster,"" he told us. More recently I saw Mr Monastyrsky arrive at the scene of a missile strike in Zaporizhzhia last September. Thirty-two people had been killed, there were fears of a second attack, but he still came. As one official reminded us: ""It's dangerous for everyone in Ukraine at the moment, for ministers and anyone else."" Ukraine's President Zelensky has also embraced the risks of being a wartime leader. Standout moments included his appearance in the liberated city Kherson on 14 November. The Russians had only pulled out a couple of days before and were just across the Dnipro River. Before his landmark visit to Washington, Ukraine's leader travelled to the eastern city of Bakhmut to address troops. At the time Russian forces were a mile or so away. Some of the heaviest fighting was happening there. These visits are a stark contrast with Russian President Vladimir Putin's more cautious approach of not visiting the front lines. He instead sends his deputies. ""We are still here"" were the words of Ukraine's leader in a video message with his top team the day after Russia invaded. He'd reportedly turned down an evacuation offer by the US. It's set the tone ever since.  Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Siobhan Leahy  Â© 2023 BBC.

Mr Baldwin had been rehearsing a scene for the Western film Rust when the shooting happened at a ranch near Sante Fe, New Mexico in October 2021. Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the film's armourer, will also be charged. Lawyers for both said they intended to fight the charges in court. Santa Fe's District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies announced the charges on Thursday, adding that they would be filed by the end of the month. ""Actor and producer Alec Baldwin and armourer Hannah Gutierrez Reed will each be charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter,"" the statement read. ""I have determined that there is sufficient evidence."" ""On my watch, no one is above the law, and everyone deserves justice,"" she said. Both face up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 (Â£4,040) fine if convicted. They will be tried by a jury, prosecutors said. Film director Joel Souza was also wounded in the shooting, but prosecutors said no charges would be filed in connection with that. The film's assistant director David Halls entered a guilty plea to a misdemeanour charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon, prosecutors said. He will spend six months serving probation.  In a statement, a lawyer for Ms Hutchins' husband, Matthew, said he supported the filing of the charges. ""It is a comfort to the family that, in New Mexico, no one is above the law,"" he said. But Mr Baldwin's lawyer, Luke Nikas, called the decision ""a terrible miscarriage of justice"". ""Mr Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun - or anywhere on the movie set,"" Mr Nikas said. ""He relied on the professionals with whom he worked, who assured him the gun did not have live rounds. We willÂ fight these charges, and we will win."" Ms Gutierrez Reed's lawyer, meanwhile, said the announcement was the result of a ""very flawed investigation and an inaccurate understanding of the full facts"". ""Hannah is, and has always been, very emotional and sad about this tragic accident,"" Todd Bullion said. ""But she did not commit involuntary manslaughter."" Ms Hutchins died in hospital shortly after she was shot in the chest by a prop gun fired by Mr Baldwin on set. The incident resulted in accusations of negligence and led to calls for better safety protocols on film sets. An initial investigation into the incident found there was ""a degree of neglect"", producers were fined more than $136,000 by the New Mexico Environment Department for failing to enforce safety protocols.  The film's production company, Rust Movie Productions, argued that it was not responsible for supervising the film set, ""much less for supervising specific protocols such as the maintenance and loading of weapons"". After the shooting, Mr Baldwin said the gun had misfired. He added that he did not pull the trigger and was not aware that it was loaded. ""I don't know what happened on that set. I don't know how that bullet arrived in that gun. I don't know,"" he said. Mr Baldwin has also filed a lawsuit against several people involved with the film, including Ms Gutierrez Reed and Mr Halls, alleging that they both failed to check the gun carefully.  In October, the 64-year-old actor and the film's production company reached a settlement for an undisclosed amount with the family of Ms Hutchins.  It came after the cinematographer's husband filed a wrongful death lawsuit which alleged violations of industry standards. ""All of us believe Halyna's death was a terrible accident,"" Mr Hutchins said in a statement at the time. ""I have no interest in engaging in recriminations or attribution of blame."" Production of the film had been scheduled to resume this year, with Mr Hutchins on board as executive producer.

Body-camera footage shows the moment police arrive at Paul Pelosi's door and confront the attacker last October. Its release follows a San Francisco court ruling that the district attorney's office must make the materials public. Alleged attacker David DePape has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges. The video shows San Francisco police entering Mr Pelosi's home on the night of 28 October, where they see Mr DePape and Mr Pelosi both holding a hammer. They direct him to drop the hammer before the attack occurs.  In a statement on Friday, Mrs Pelosi said she has ""absolutely no intention of seeing the deadly assault on my husband's life"".  ""I won't be making any more statements about this case, as it proceeds, except to again, thank people [for well-wishes] and inform them of Paul's progress,"" she said. Court documents filed last year allege Mr DePape had planned to hold Mrs Pelosi - a Californian congresswoman who was not home at the time of the attack - hostage and break ""her kneecaps"" if she ""lied"" to him. Mr DePape told police at the scene that he was sick of the ""lies coming out of Washington DC"". Police have previously said Mr DePape told them he was on a ""suicide mission"" when he smashed in the glass backdoor of the Pelosi home in the upmarket Pacific Heights neighbourhood. He is facing numerous charges, including assault with a deadly weapon and attempted murder. The 42-year-old Canadian national also pleaded not guilty to federal charges of attempting to kidnap a federal official and assaulting a federal official's family member filed by the US Department of Justice.  No trial date has been set for Mr DePape.  Mr Pelosi was sent to the hospital after the attack, where he underwent surgery for a skull fracture. He also sustained injuries to his hands and right arm.  He was discharged within six days and has been making a slow recovery, and had his first public appearance in early December.  Â© 2023 BBC.

Officials said two paramedics and a driver who responded to the scene did not provide him with adequate care.  He was punched, kicked and hit with a baton after being pulled over for an alleged traffic violation.  Five policemen have been fired and charged with murder. It emerged on Monday two others have been suspended.  Memphis officials named the three sacked workers - all employed by the fire department - as Robert Long, JaMichael Sandridge and Lt Michelle Whitaker. They had ""failed to conduct an adequate patient assessment of Mr Nichols"", they said.  All three violated numerous department policies, Memphis Fire Department Chief Gina Sweat said, without providing further details.  ""Their actions or inactions on the scene that night do not meet the expectations of the Memphis Fire Department,"" she said.  Body camera video and other footage were released publicly on Friday and they show Mr Nichols, 29, was beaten by police officers on 7 January after he was pulled over.  Mr Long and Mr Sandridge responded to a call about a person being pepper-sprayed and arrived at 20:41 to find Mr Nichols handcuffed on the ground propped up against a police vehicle, officials said.  They requested an ambulance, according to the fire department. The ambulance was dispatched at 20:46, arrived on the scene at 20:55 and Mr Nichols was admitted to hospital at 21:08, according to the press release. The firings come after Memphis officials said they had suspended Preston Hemphill, 26, one of the police officers who initially stopped Mr Nichols for an alleged traffic violation.   A lawyer for Mr Hemphill said the officer was co-operating with the investigation.  The Memphis Police Department said later on Monday that a second officer had been suspended in connection with Mr Nichols' death, though it did not name this officer.  Mr Nichols died three days after the traffic stop, in hospital on 10 January.   Lee Gerald, a lawyer for Mr Hemphill, said his client was on the scene at the initial stop of Mr Nichols, and that the first video of the encounter released to the public came from Mr Hemphill's body camera. This video can not be played Watch: New footage shows deadly arrest of Tyre Nichols ""As per departmental regulations officer Hemphill activated his bodycam,"" Mr Gerald said in a statement shared with the BBC.

Officers can be heard shouting profanities and ordering Mr Nichols out of his car. The officers then force him to the ground before he breaks free.  The subsequent videos show officers catching up with Mr Nichols in a residential area before pinning him down to the ground and beating him. According to attorneys for Mr Nichols' family, Mr Hemphill is the officer shown on video ""violently pulling Nichols from his car while hitting him on the ground with a Taser"", they wrote in a statement.  After Mr Nichols fled the scene of the traffic stop, the attorneys allege, Mr Hemphill could be heard saying: ""I hope they stomp his ass.""  Mr Hemphill is white. The five former officers charged with second-degree murder in the case are black. Mr Nichols was also black. Memphis Police Department said they would provide more details on Mr Hemphill's alleged role ""once information is available"". Mr Nichols' death has once again highlighted issues surrounding police brutality in the US, reigniting calls in Congress for law enforcement reform. In a statement on Sunday, Congressional Black Caucus chair and Democratic House representative Steven Horsford asked for a meeting with President Joe Biden about the matter.

Astronomers say the object's journey toward us took around 50,000 years. Photographs captured by astronomers show a distinct green hue around the body of the comet. But those expecting a brilliant streak of emerald in the sky will be disappointed. Its brightness is right at the threshold of what is visible to the naked eye. ""You might have seen these reports saying we're going to get this bright green object lighting up the sky,"" says Dr Robert Massey, deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society.  ""Sadly, that's not going to be anything like the case.""  However, away from light pollution and below dark skies, you might be able to see a smudge in the sky - if you know what you're looking for.  Would-be stargazers have a better chance of spotting it using binoculars, in which it will appear as a faint white blur.  ""Even a small pair of binoculars will help you find it,"" says Massey. Comets are mostly composed of ice and dust. As they approach the Sun, the ice is vaporised and the dust shaken off to create the signature long tail. ""If you're lucky, you'll see a hint of the tail coming off it, so it'll look more like a classic comet,"" says Massey.  Astronomers discovered the comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) last March at the Palomar Observatory in California.  It has been visible to those in the Northern Hemisphere through binoculars for the past few weeks. But it will make its closest approach to Earth at around 41 million km (26 million miles) away this Wednesday.  The object originates in the Oort cloud, a collection of icy bodies at the edge of the Solar System.  To find it, Massey suggests first searching for the pole star, which is always in the same place in the sky.  You can identify the pole star by looking directly north and locating a star that hangs distinctly by itself. You can then use free planetarium software online to determine where the comet will be moving in relation to the pole star on the night you're looking at it.  The best time to view it will be in the early hours of Thursday morning when the Moon has set. At that time the comet should appear just to the right of the pole star.  A green appearance for comets is not uncommon and is usually the result of breakdown of a reactive molecule called dicarbon - two carbon atoms joined together by a double bond.  Such colour is better picked up by digital cameras, which are more sensitive to colour.  The comet will not match the spectacle of the 2020 Comet NEOWISE - the brightest comet visible from the Northern Hemisphere since 1997. But the Planetary Society said ""an opportunity to see it will only come once in a lifetime"". Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The woman, who was travelling on a Vistara flight from Abu Dhabi, was arrested in Mumbai on Monday and later released on police bail. Her lawyer has denied the allegations, saying it is a ""false story"". But Vistara said its staff had to restrain the woman for ""continued unruly conduct and violent behaviour"". The Times of India newspaper reported that a Vistara staff member alleged in a police complaint that the passenger punched them and spat on their colleague. According to the complaint, the crew member had objected after the woman left her economy class seat to sit in business class. The complaint also accuses the woman of ""stripping and littering the plane"". Vistara said in a statement that the flight's captain ""issued a warning card and made a decision to restrain the customer"" because of her behaviour. The woman's lawyer, Prabhakar Tripathi, told the BBC that she was ""uncomfortable"" in her allotted seat and ""requested to be moved to a vacant seat"" and that caused a ""disagreement"" with the crew. He said she was also allegedly not allowed to use the bathroom due to turbulence. ""She was later allowed to go to the washroom but was tied up on return,"" Mr Tripathi said. He also denied media reports which quoted police officers as saying that the woman was drunk. A senior Mumbai police official told reporters that the woman was ""booked for misbehaving"". ""We served her a notice and produced her before the court, following which she was allowed to go,"" said Dikshit Gedam, a deputy commissioner of police.  Scrutiny of misconduct by air passengers has increased in India after a man was arrested in January for allegedly urinating on a female passenger - the incident sparked criticism of how the airline, Air India, had handled the incident.

A series of controversial protests in Sweden, including the burning of a Quran, have angered Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in recent days. As Turkey is already a member of Nato, it can block applications to join. Mr Haavisto said that the demonstrations had clearly put ""brake on the progress"" of the negotiations. Turkey said the Swedish government's decision not to prevent Rasmus Paludan, a politician from the Danish far-right Stram Kurs (Hard Line) party, from burning a copy of Islam's holy book in public was ""completely unacceptable"". Talks between the countries have stalled over a number of issues - including Turkey's demands that the Nordic nations deport those it views as terrorists - and look to be on hold until after Turkish elections in mid-May. But Mr Haavisto insisted that the Nordic countries would join the bloc together, and that he saw no need to rush negotiations.  The diplomat's comments appear to row back on an interview he gave to the Finnish broadcaster Yle just hours earlier, in which he suggested his country should consider joining the military alliance without Sweden, after Mr Erdogan said his country would not back Sweden's bid. Finland and Sweden launched their bid to join Nato after Russia invaded Ukraine, fearing for their safety and ending a decades long stance of non-alignment. The two have pledged to join simultaneously but protests in Sweden are hampering progress. Speaking on Tuesday to Reuters news agency, Mr Haavisto said a ""time-out"" was needed so that the trio could see where the ""dust has settled after the current situation"". ""I think there will be a break for a couple of weeks,"" he added. However, it's not just protests in Sweden which have hindered its Nato bid. Turkey is also calling on Sweden to distance itself from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is regarded as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU. Turkey also wants other political concessions, including the deportation of critics of Mr Erdogan, and Kurds that it claims are terrorists. Exacerbating tensions further, on Monday, Mr Erdogan said Turkish elections had been brought forward by a month to 14 May. Mr Haavisto said the ""pressure"" of the looming ballot has caused discussions to become ""heated"" within Turkey, suggesting Turkey's government may be taking a more hardline stance against Sweden's support of the YPG and the protests which have also seen an effigy of the president hung upside down, in a bid to garner support.

Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC that Germany had a ""special responsibility"", having built up ""huge Russian funds"" before the war by buying its gas. Ukraine sees the tanks as vital for breaking through Russian lines and to beat an anticipated counter-offensive. But as Leopard 2s are made in Germany, Berlin needs to approve their export. Germany has been hesitant to send its own or allow other nations to do the same.  One of its concerns is that a sudden move could further escalate the conflict with Russia. Mr Morawiecki said he would give Germany one or two weeks to make a decision - but would send its tanks, whatever Berlin says. ""We will do this, no matter what the decision is going to be,"" he said. ""But we want to go along the procedures which are requested of us."" He also maintained that Germany should send some of its own Leopard 2s - he said they had 350 operational Leopard tanks and 200 in storage. ""Why keep them in storage?"" he asked.  President Zelensky believes about 300 Leopard tanks would help it defeat Russia. The German government told the BBC it had received the request to export 14 German-made tanks on Tuesday. The Leopard 2 tanks were specifically designed to compete with the Russian T-90 tanks, which are being used in the invasion.  In a BBC interview, Mr Morawiecki said that an urgent move from Germany was ""so important"".  ""This is why we have talk to our German partners, not to procrastinate, not to delay, but just to take brave decisions,"" he said.  ""Germany played a key role in building up the huge Russian funds for this war by buying Russian gas, trading with Russia, big time. Now there is a special responsibility on Germany's shoulders,"" he added. He earlier accused Germany of ""delaying, dodging, acting in a way that is difficult to understand"". Mr Morawiecki said that Poland was ""just about to send"" 50 to 60 more tanks to Ukraine. He did not name the type of tank, but was probably referring to more Soviet-era tanks. Poland has already sent about 250 Soviet era T-72 tanks to Ukraine. On Tuesday, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Berlin had given allied nations the green light to train Ukrainians to use Leopard 2 tanks, but did not commit to sending their own. Mr Pistorius said a decision about supplying the tanks would be made soon. The military's chief of staff added that any decision would be taken at a political level.  ""We are encouraging our partners if they want to, and if they have the opportunity, to start training Ukrainian forces on these Leopard vehicles,"" Mr Pistorius said in a news conference with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. Allied nations have become frustrated at what they perceive as German reluctance to send the armoured vehicles in recent days. But Miguel Berger, Germany's ambassador to the UK, told the BBC that decisions would ""not be driven by the news cycle"". Sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine ""would put pressure and additional tension on the relationship between Germany and Russia"", he said. ""Chancellor Scholz needs to have the time to analyse the strategic implications of the decision and then make a decision with partners - this is very important."" Speaking on Tuesday, Poland's Defence Minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said he was appealing to Germany to ""join the coalition of countries supporting Ukraine with Leopard 2 tanks"".  ""This is our common cause, because the security of the whole of Europe is at stake!"" he added. But Mr Pistorius defended German Chancellor Olaf Scholz against criticism that he was dragging his feet. ""Taking the lead does not mean blindly going ahead,"" he said. ""And if the decision takes another day or two, then that's just the way it is.""  The UK has promised 14 Challenger tanks, while France is considering sending some of its Leclerc battle tanks.

167,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,Culture of Sicilian silence that protected Mafia boss,Fear and the old code of silence helped shield Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro for 30 years.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64353448,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A70E/production/_128366724_dba960b0e3a79698d877b67ddf0c9c3ad52ee95b.jpg,2023-01-22T00:53:23Z,"Palermo residents couldn't have known for sure who the man being led to the police car was. After all, it had been 30 years since he was last seen in public. But over a hundred members of the armed forces had gathered in the narrow streets of Palermo that morning - and people knew of only one criminal who could elicit that kind of response. Matteo Messina Denaro - the ""boss of the bosses"", the last fugitive - had been found. Applause and cheers broke out. Somebody high-fived a policeman; others went in for a hug; some had tears in their eyes. Everyone was beaming. Later, Maria Falcone told Italian media she wished her brother could have witnessed the scene.  Anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone was murdered by Sicily's Cosa Nostra, spearheaded by Messina Denaro, in 1992. It was the height of the ""massacre season"" that had plagued Italy in the early 1990s.  At the time, Messina Denaro's organised crime syndicate was attempting, through a sustained murder campaign that killed more than 20 people, to force the state into negotiations about the hard prison regime for jailed Mafia associates. Messina Denaro once reportedly boasted he could ""fill a cemetery"" with his victims. He was instrumental in the 1993 kidnapping and killing of Giuseppe Di Matteo, the 11-year-old son of a mafioso-turned-state witness. The boy was held in captivity for two years before being killed; his body was dissolved in acid to prevent the family from burying him.  Messina Denaro also ordered the killing of a rival Mafia boss and his pregnant girlfriend. A warrant was put out for his arrest. Then, in the summer of 1993, he vanished without a trace. Reported sightings placed him everywhere from Venezuela to the Netherlands.  But it was in Palermo - the heart of his homeland of Sicily - that he was caught. This week, after his arrest, police uncovered three hideouts in Campobello di Mazara, a sun-soaked village 115km (70 miles) from Palermo - and 10km from his birthplace of Castelvetrano.  Quiet, small Campobello is not the kind of place one could imagine hiding in very easily. Not that Messina Denaro appears to have led the life of a secretive outlaw.  It seems he was a regular customer of the local Bar San Vito; a neighbour said they frequently greeted one another.  It is an image deeply at odds with the 30-year search for the mobster.  Italy invests large amounts of resources in its anti-mafia operations - but the case of Messina Denaro shows that a compliant culture of silence can still put a dent in the state's battle against organised crime. Maurizio Bellacosa, criminal lawyer and law professor at LUISS University in Rome, said that Messina Denaro ""made full use of Mafia culture"" to remain undetected. Mafia culture worked as a combination of intertwined elements, Prof Bellacosa told the BBC: ""From the Mafia's widespread presence in the territory, to a scarce or non-existent co-operation with investigators by society, to an entrenched code of silence, especially in small towns and suburbs, where the state is often perceived as absent."" The mayor of Campobello, Giuseppe Castiglione, told Italian media he had been ""so dejected by the thought that Messina Denaro lived among us for at least a year - because now I know that my fellow residents chose to go down the road of complacency and bury their head in the sand instead"". However, silence does not necessarily mean assent.  The Mafia's tentacles stretch deep into Sicilian society. Fear and the old code of silence are still entrenched.  ""Mafia-style association works in a very simple way: violence and intimidation provoke a condition of subjugation and 'omertÃ ' in those involved,"" said Mr Bellacosa.  ""In essence, the Mafia uses fear to achieve its goals."" In the press conference given by police following the arrest, Palermo prosecutor Maurizio de Lucia said that Messina Denaro had likely been aided by the ""Mafioso bourgeoisie"" - referring to local professionals, entrepreneurs and politicians.  This is shown by the arrests made over the years of people deemed close to Messina Denaro. Palermo-based journalist Tullio Filippone said these were individuals who ""accepted to live and collaborate with the Mafia, turning a blind eye when Mafia associates need medical examinations, appraisals or asset management."" This local network was found to be aiding the mobster by laundering his money, said Mr Filippone, and was ""what culturally makes the difference and what needs to be eradicated."" ""Every Sicilian knows that the Mafia exists... [and] it has the power to influence society and exert control over the territory in a capillary way."" Whether Messina Denaro was leading a life of retirement, or whether he was still active and engaged in criminal activities is unclear - and it may yet turn out that his spectacular arrest was the easy part.  This video can not be played Watch: Moment Matteo Messina Denaro is detained in Palermo, Sicily Although the years of car bombs and heinous violence may be over, most experts agree that over the years, the Mafia has transformed into a less flashy yet arguably more insidious organisation. Racketeering, intimidation and extortion have not gone away: ""It is still here, as is shown by the fact that a godfather could remain hidden for so long."" In this context, the spontaneous applause on the morning of the arrest was picked up by many as an extraordinary sign of change.  Ms Falcone, the sister of the slain judge, said she was struck by ""how everyone was cheering - in the street, among the buses, people hugging the police in their bulletproof vests. It's a victory for Italian society as a whole"". There are other signs that change may be afoot.  Earlier this week, high school students took to the streets of the town chanting ""Castelvetrano is ours, not yours"".  An 18-year-old told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: ""I shivered with emotion when I saw people applauding the police. This crowded square is proof that this town doesn't want to be labelled by the Mafia"".  Another student said: ""I felt proud when I heard he had been caught."" Older generations may hold different views. Mr Filippone said that in Sicily there were 60-year-olds who had lived through the murders of the 1990s, and yet they defended Messina Denaro - and almost denied there was a problem. Mr Filippone was referring to a series of interviews with elderly Castelvetrano residents aired by Italian TV earlier in the week. In one, a man says he doesn't judge the actions of Messina Denaro; in another, a resident says arresting the mobster was a mistake.  ""But younger peopleâ¦ took to the streets to demonstrate their happiness at such an important moment. This highlights the contrast between different generations, and that things are gradually changing,"" Mr Filippone told the BBC. At least symbolically, the arrest of Messina Denaro is hugely significant - even ""a form of liberation,"" said Mr Filippone.  ""All those people applauding really show what it represents for the history of Sicily and the country: the end of an era, a catharsis.""  Â© 2023 BBC.

Richard ""Bigo"" Barnett was among the crowd of Trump supporters who stormed the building in attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election result.  He posed for cameras after breaking into Mrs Pelosi's office and boasted of swiping an envelope before leaving.  He was armed with a stun gun and could have harmed Mrs Pelosi, officials say.  A jury in Washington DC deliberated for less than three hours before convicting Barnett of all eight charges against him.  His crimes include obstruction of an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly weapon, and theft of government property. Prosecutors argued that Barnett, 62, came to Washington DC from his home in Arkansas - over 1,000 miles away (1,600km) - prepared for violence.  ""We can only imagine what would have happened if (Pelosi) had been there at the time,"" federal prosecutor Alison Prout argued, according to the Associated Press.  Mrs Pelosi, who was Speaker of the House of Representatives at the time, was forced to flee the chamber floor with other lawmakers as protesters stormed the building.  Barnett, a former firefighter, chose to testify in his own defence during the trial. He argued that he was caught up ""in the moment"" and was ""going with the flow"", according to the Associated Press.  Barnett wrote a note on Mrs Pelosi's desk using a sexist slur, and used a bullhorn to brag to the crowd that ""I took Nancy Pelosi's office"" after police forced him out of the building.  After the verdict was read on Monday, Barnett said he did not get a fair trial because the jury was not made up of his ""peers"". His lawyer, Joe McBride, said he would appeal. ""Washington DC, is not a state. He's not surrounded by people of Arkansas, where he came from,"" said Mr McBride, referring to the city's status as a district rather than one of the 50 US states.  The judge allowed him to remain free until his sentencing hearing on 3 May. He is facing decades in federal prison. The Barnett trial has been one of the most high-profile to stem from the 6 January 2021 attack on Congress. More than 940 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the breach and nearly 500 have pleaded guilty so far.  A jury on Monday also convicted four members of the far-right Oath Keepers group of seditious conspiracy for their role in the 2021 attack. The conviction is a rare one tied to a Civil War-era law that prohibits plots to overthrow or conspire against the state.  Two other Oath Keepers members, including the group's founder Stewart Rhodes, were also convicted on seditious conspiracy in November after a separate trial. Prosecutors said Rhodes acted as a ""battlefield general"" during the attacks, and plotted to use violence to stop the certification of the 2020 US presidential election.  Those convicted of seditious conspiracy face up to 20 years in prison.  Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

Previous efforts were hampered by adverse weather conditions as the US state has been hit by deadly storms. There has been no sign of the 65-year-old since he disappeared on 13 January. Mr Sands had been hiking in the Baldy Bowl area of the San Gabriel Mountains, north of Los Angeles, when he went missing. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's department tweeted that it would use a helicopter from the California Highway Patrol which carries a device that can detect matching ""reflective material, electronics, and in some cases, credit cards"". It added that using the RECCO machine could help police ""pinpoint an area where we can focus our search efforts"". On Wednesday, the sheriff's department said a second hiker who had gone missing in the same area was found alive.  He was named by local media as 75-year-old Los Angeles resident Jin Chung.  Mr Chung was missing for about 48 hours, during which time he suffered some ""weather-related injuries and a leg injury"", said the sheriff's department. For the past several weeks, local authorities have frequently put out statements urging hikers to avoid hazardous mountainous areas ""regardless of precautions taken"" saying that the conditions have made it ""difficult to deploy resources to that area when a hiker goes missing"".  Avalanches in the area last week held back ground search and rescue efforts for Mr Sands. One of his brothers, Nick Sands, said he had already said his ""goodbyes"". ""I have come to terms with the fact he's gone and for me that's how I've dealt with it,"" said Mr Sands, who lives in the English county of North Yorkshire where he, Julian and their three other brothers grew up. His family have thanked the US authorities for their efforts in trying to find the actor, who has appeared in dozens of films and TV shows, including the lead role in the 1985 romance A Room With A View. In a statement, the family praised the ""heroic search teams"" who are working through the difficult weather conditions ""on the ground and in the air to bring Julian home"". Mr Sands lives in the North Hollywood neighbourhood of Los Angeles with his wife, writer Evgenia Citkowitz. They have two children. He was previously married to Sarah Sands, former editor of BBC Radio 4's Today programme, with whom he has a son. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Instead, they joined together in mourning as the community held a vigil for 11 people murdered at a local dance hall just two days before. Residents and leaders of the city's Asian-American community organised a candlelight memorial outside the city hall on Monday evening to honour the victims, holding a powerful three-minute moment of silence and reciting prayers from a range of faiths.  ""Our joyous Lunar New Year celebration was turned utterly upside down into tragedy and fear,"" said Representative Judy Chu. ""We must support one another and work our way through this."" On 21 January, a gunman entered the Star Ballroom Dance Studio and opened fire. Though the shooting had occurred late on Saturday night, Monday brought fresh waves of grief for Monterey Park. That afternoon, authorities announced another person had succumbed to their injuries, bringing the death toll to 11.  Names of the victims have slowly trickled out through officials or media reports, with each announcement unleashing fresh trauma.  Authorities have so far revealed that My Nhan, 65, Lilan Li, 63, Xiujuan Yu, 57, and Valentino Alvero, 68, died in the shooting. Two other victims, Ming Wei Ma, and Nancy Liu, 63, were identified by family members. The only suspect, 72-year-old Huu Can Tran, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a widely-televised search of the region.  His motive remains unknown but more about him emerged at a police press conference on Monday when it was disclosed that he recently went to police to make allegations against his family.  Police in Hemet, the California town where Tran lived, said he twice came in person this month to the police station to make claims of theft, fraud and poisoning going back 10 to 20 years. A former friend of Tran told the Associated Press he often complained that people at the dancing clubs did not like him. While the city still lacked many key answers behind the tragedy, Monterey Park has become the latest epicentre of America's ongoing debate over gun violence. By mid-afternoon on Monday, it became clear Monterey Park was not the only California city suffering from the aftermath of a shooting. Nearly 300 miles north, in the town of Half Moon Bay, a gunman killed seven people. Local radio stations, broadcasting California news at the top of the hour, led with back-to-back shootings. ""Can we do something to make sure these nutty people don't get guns?"" said Qiang Bjornbak, a lawyer who came to a community centre on Monday to assist with volunteer efforts. ""These nutty people cannot go to these places and hurt people. That's what I'm concerned about."" ""That person had a way to get a gun, and the tragedy happened,"" she said. Suzy Liu, an employee at a local Chinese herb shop, had forbidden her children to play outside until police apprehended the suspect. ""I'm afraid. It was scary. We will take the children to the playground in the future to make up for it,"" she told BBC News. The attack struck at the core of the city's Asian-American population and particularly its vibrant community of amateur dancers who gather at venues like Star Dance Studios to take lessons and cut loose.  Outside the entrance of Star Dance Studio, mourners from the neighbourhood and wider region came to lay flowers and say a brief prayer.  The dance halls were ""part of the community, so that's why it's very sad,"" said Ms Bjornbak, who had attended Star Dance Studios a handful of times and praised their instructors. ""It's more than entertainment, it's your hobby."" One of the victims, studio manager Ming Wei Ma, was a close friend, she said.  ""He was a very, very talented person. He was good at organising the dancing events, the singing events, the New Year's gala,"" she said.  Immediately after the shooting, the gunman had fled to a second dance hall, Lai Lai Ballroom and Studio. There, 26-year-old employee Brandon Tsay disarmed him, in what community leaders have hailed as a heroic act. On Monday, three roommates, Diana Yee, 37, Victor Tham, 43, and Kevin Vong, 30, arrived at Lai Lai Ballroom and Studio with a bouquet of flowers, intent on paying their respects at each location impacted by the shooting. ""I am a dancer and I know that how much I love the beauty of life and grace and joy that comes from dancing,"" Ms Yee told the BBC. ""And Mr Tran was a dancer and that light got lost, somehow along the way."" The nature of the shooting had prompted deep reflection from Ms Yee and others in the community, as they struggled to make sense of how a man could turn on his neighbours in such a merciless way.  At the vigil, one of the pastors said he would include the suspected gunman in his prayers. ""It's a conversation about how do we sit with our most painful feelings?"" Ms Yee said. ""How do we take care of each other's feelings, and embrace? That is the hardest work."" ""This is a time where you sit together with the community,"" she said, ""to find where the love is again.""

The firm now owns the pop star's stake in some of the biggest hits of recent years, including Baby and Sorry. Bieber, one of the best-selling artists of the 21st Century, joins a growing group of artists who have cashed out on their catalogues. The move means Hipgnosis will receive a payment every time a song it owns is streamed or used on radio, TV or film. The company - a $1bn venture between financial giant Blackstone and the British Hipgnosis Song Management - acquired Bieber's publishing copyrights to his 290-song back catalogue.  It has also acquired his share in the original master recordings of his songs. That includes all of his music released before 31 December 2021. Hipgnosis has not disclosed the terms of the deal, but a source told the news agency AFP it was worth around $200m. Artists are increasingly selling stakes in their work to music funds, although the trend is more common among older artists. In the last two years, music legends Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen both sold back catalogue rights to Sony.  Springsteen received a reported $500m (Â£376m) for the sale of his life's work. By Sean Farrington, BBC Wake up to Money and Today business presenter Up-and-coming artists may now be watching Justin Bieber's pension plans as closely as they do announcements for his new music. Bieber had a choice - continue to reap the rewards every single time one of his hits gets played, or cash in now and sell the rights in a lump sum. Bieber's bet is he's better off with latter. It's a move often made by singers much older than him. As the investor who bought the rights put it to me: ""It gives him an opportunity to put his money to work for himself, and he's de-risking his future."" How will he put that money to work? Maybe music's queen of entrepreneurialism, the billionaire Rihanna, could give him a few tips. Hipgnosis Songs Capital is separate entity to the Hipgnosis Songs Fund, which has also been building up a catalogue of classic hits and inviting big institutional investors to share in the proceeds.  The fund floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2018, while Hipgnosis Songs Capital is a private company. The man behind both companies is Merck Mercuriadis, who has claimed hit songs can be ""more valuable than gold or oil"". He said Bieber's music was ""arguably the definitive soundtrack of the streaming revolution"", with 13 songs that have each achieved more than a billion streams on platforms like YouTube and Spotify. As his audience are still relatively young, he added, royalties will continue to pour in for ""60 or 70 years"". ""The beautiful thing about music is that when these songs become hits, they become part of the fabric of our lives and they live on forever,"" Mercuriadis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However, his fund's share price has fallen by more than 27% since this time last year, as investor interest has waned. In December, Mercuriadis called the share price situation a ""disappointment"", but said he believed in the company's long-term profitability. ""In the wider music market, people continue to listen to and pay for music irrespective of today's cost of living challenges with annual audio streams in the US passing the one trillion mark for the first time,"" he said. ""These are all exciting indicators for the further growth that we will experience as income flows through the collection process into Hipgnosis."" The company's share price rose by 1.6% after the Justin Bieber deal was announced, even though it is not involved in that purchase. Â© 2023 BBC.

He has led the president's Covid task force, served as a top economic adviser and been on the board of prominent, profitable multinationals. And for many in Washington DC, he is also known as the co-founder of a wildly popular and much beloved chain of ""Jew-ish"" bagel shops favoured by local officer workers and President Joe Biden alike.  The restaurant promises to deliver bagels that are a cross between a ""classic New York style bagel"" and the ""sweeter, Montreal-style bagels from our friends up north"".  The chain, ""Call Your Mother"", was founded in 2018, when Mr Zients was working in the private sector as a member of Facebook's board of advisors and the CEO of Wall Street investment firm Cranemere.  One of the chain's co-founders, Andrew Dana, told the BBC that the successful bagel business was born over an equally delicious meal - pizzas -  after he was introduced to Mr Zients by his father, who had been a summer camp companion of his in New Hampshire in the 1960s.  At the time of the meeting, Mr Dana recalled, he was unaware of Mr Zients experiences as top economic advisor under the Barack Obama administration. ""My dad told me he was interested in opening a restaurant. That was all the background I got. I was expecting to go sit with some 24-year-old,"" he said.  ""We had lunch, hit it off and decided to do something together. Then I went home, Googled him and saw his Wikipedia page. I was like 'whoa nelly!'"" The meeting ended with the unlikely pair hitting it off.  ""Over that lunch we decided to do something together and come up with a fun concept,"" Mr Dana said. ""I went back to the drawing pad with my wife and partner Daniela, and we drew up what would become Call Your Mother - and he was stoked about it.""  Far from being a quiet, behind-the-scenes investor, Mr Dana said that Mr Zients was actively involved in the creation of the first restaurant, including a long series of taste tests.  ""Every weekend for about nine months before we opened, Dani and I would take bagels over to his house and do live taste tests to see how the bagel recipes were coming along,"" he said.  Backed by Mr Zients, Call Your Mother became a runaway success. Even as other Washington DC restaurants suffered during the pandemic, the chain flourished, and now boasts seven locations, with another on the way.  In January 2021, Call Your Mother also became the first restaurant in which Joe Biden dined out in Washington as president.  The president's visit, however, came after Mr Zients had divested from the restaurant and taken a role in the Biden administration as Counselor to the President and White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator.  On Friday, Mr Biden formally announced that Mr Zients would be taking over in early February as his chief of staff, managing his schedule and driving his policy agenda. Mr Dana and Mr Zients, however, have remained friends. Mr Dana said that he occasionally still takes bagels over to his home.  His favourite bagel? ""A sesame bagel, scooped hard and double-toasted,"" Mr Dana said.  Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

The planes were on a routine ""operational flying training mission"" when the incident happened, the air force said in a statement. Both aircraft had taken off from the Gwailor air base in Madhya Pradesh, about 50km (30m) east of where they came down.  The air force has ordered an inquiry to determine the cause of the crash. The crash involved a Russian-made Sukhoi Su-30 carrying two pilots, and a French-build Mirage 2000, flown by one pilot.  Local media reports said wreckage was found in Bharatpur in Rajasthan and Morena in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. Police officer Dharmender Gaur, at one scene where wreckage was discovered, told AFP news agency that a pilot had been found injured but alive in the forests of Padargarh.  ""We have located the wreckage of one of the planes,"" the officer said. ""The other plane has likely fallen further away from the site and we have sent teams to locate it."" Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said local authorities had been instructed to assist with the air force's rescue and relief efforts.  The crash is the latest in a series of aviation accidents involving India's military air force. In October last year five soldiers were killed when their helicopter crashed in Arunachal Pradesh state, near the border with China, while in December 2021 the head of India's armed forces, Gen Bipin Rawat, was among more than a dozen killed when the helicopter they were travelling in hit a hillside and burst into flames in Tamil Nadu state.

The 29-year-old died after a violent encounter with five black officers who have since been charged. The BBC spoke to serving and retired black officers about what happened - and what needs to change. Terrance Hopkins has served in the Dallas Police Department for more than 30 years. He said the video footage of Tyre Nichols' arrest - which showed officers repeatedly punching and kicking the father of one after a traffic stop - left him grief-stricken and embarrassed. ""I'm extremely disappointed because they've dishonoured our legacy - our legacy in this profession is to be the officer who does not have those biases against black people,"" he told the BBC. ""That's one of the reasons why I'm in the department. Their actions embarrassed our part of law enforcement."" As president of the Black Police Association of Greater Dallas, Mr Hopkins said what the police did triggered shame and disappointment among black officers. ""I know that if I come across a black individual or suspect that he's going to be treated right,"" he said. ""There is not going to be an ounce of racism in that contact."" ""But what these guys just did set us back to the Dark Ages."" De Lacy Davis, who is now retired, joined the East Orange New Jersey Police Department in the 1980s and later founded Black Cops Against Police Brutality. He said what happened in Memphis was ""shameful, inhumane and a poor representation"" of black police officers. ""I've been meeting for two days with black police officers around the country that I have relationships with,"" he said. ""[We] need to take a position nationally so that we send a clear message about what we don't stand with. That's number one."" Mr Davis said the incident pointed to a clear failure in the department's culture. ""It doesn't matter what colour the cop is - what matters is the culture of the organisation,"" he said. ""Because the race of the officer is irrelevant, it is the practice of the institution."" He added that police violence towards ethnic minorities was - in his view - ""baked into the system"". ""We have a responsibility to our community as professionals, either those that are still in or those who have retired like me to carve a path for the next generation of black officers,"" Mr Davis said. Howard University law Professor Lenese Herbert is a former assistant US attorney. ""One of the best things about that job was working with police officers with pride and standards who were lawful,"" she told the BBC. She draws a distinction between ordinary policing and the way the officers behaved during the Tyre Nichols arrest: ""This was not in any sense lawful policing. This was theâ¦ conduct of those who are used to getting away with violence and abuses."" ""This may be done under the guise of policing, but this was brutality in the name of, under the badge of, under the colour of, law enforcement,"" she said. The five officers charged with second-degree murder have not entered a plea, but lawyers for two of the men earlier said they would plead not guilty.  Prof Herbert said the race of those involved was less significant than the fact they were police officers in the first place. ""The only colour that matters here,"" she said, ""is blue. The blue was the thing that governed the activities [in the Tyre Nichols arrest]."" Some officers, however, said they are worried about the impact Mr Nichols' death would have on the image of black police officers more generally - and on efforts to build more diverse police departments. ""We should be thinking: Don't be a part of the problem, be a part of the solution,"" Mr Hopkins said. ""If you're seeing your people get unfair treatment from a generally white officer, why don't you become a good officer who's not going to do that? Now, that mindset is tainted based on what has happened."" ""Our applications are so low on the African American side,"" he said. ""It's going in the wrong direction."" An analysis by USA Today found that in at least 50 medium to large US cities, the percentage of black officers was less than half that of the black population. The problem was compounded after the high-profile death of George Floyd, when applications reportedly dropped and early retirements spiked. Both men said they empathised with the stigma of joining the police as a black officer and had experienced it themselves. Mr Davis met resistance even from within his own family. ""'I can't believe you work for the police,'"" they told him. People in the neighbourhood where he lived - which was the same area he also patrolled - would throw rubbish into the seats of his car. ""When I stopped getting garbage in my car, it meant I had built a better relationship with the community,"" he said. And when Mr Hopkins first joined in 1990, he too faced criticism from those who looked like him. ""I got called a sell-out,"" he said. ""Police were seen as the traitors of the black community. That was the perception for some. I'd be lying if I told you I didn't think about that."" ""The overwhelming majority of us are doing it right,"" Mr Hopkins said. ""This incident does not erase that other 99%. I want us to continue to want to be in law enforcement, and we need those numbers to remain as high as we can get them because there's no other community plagued by these issues as much as the African American community."" ""We need our stake in law enforcement,"" he said. This video can not be played Watch: New footage shows deadly arrest of Tyre Nichols Whether or not increasing diversity in the police will solve the issue of violence towards communities of colour is disputed. And the death of Tyre Nichols points to something experts and activists have long said - that discrimination in policing goes beyond the individual level and is systemic and institutional. ""When policing as an institution has a training problem, then it means that all police officers have a problem,"" Mr Davis said. ""Because the training is flawed."" He proposes putting more black officers at the head of police academies and police training courses - those who have had a ""black experience that is consistent with the community's"". He also believes training must be tied to the values of responsibility, accountability and integrity. And when those values are breached - officers must be held responsible.  Mr Hopkins, meanwhile, believes there ""has to be a push"" to recruit more black officers. ""The stigma is going to have to fade to open up the minds and hearts to a potential career in law enforcement,"" he said. Mr Davis wants to see a clear change in behaviour. ""What we can do is give them a different example to look at - and that is what has not happened yet.""  Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Mr Saakashvili - who appeared via video at Wednesday's hearing - was sent to prison in 2021. He was convicted of committing abuses of power while in office. He says the charges were politically motivated.  Since his imprisonment, his health has deteriorated significantly and he has alleged he was poisoned by authorities. Mr Saakashvili was arrested in 2021 after making a surprise return to Georgia by smuggling himself into the country on a ferry from Ukraine. He called for mass anti-government demonstrations, but was quickly arrested by Georgian authorities.  He was convicted in absentia of abuses of power while in office. He was imprisoned in October 2021 and the moved to a private clinic in May last year. The Georgian Justice Minister Rati Bregadze said he was self-harming and his condition was a result of his refusal to eat.  Mr Saakashvili's medical team said his weight had dropped from 115kg (254 pounds) to 68kg (150 pounds) since he was sent to jail. Among the world leaders calling for his release were Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said authorities were ""torturing and killing"" him.  During a press conference, Mr Zelensky said he believed the current Georgian government was trying ""to kill"" Mr Saakashvili.  Mr Saakashvili was granted Ukrainian citizenship in 2015, and spoke only in Ukrainian at his court appearance, wearing a t-shirt with ""I am Ukrainian"" printed on it. He also served as the governor of the western province of Odesa between 2015 and 2016. The Moldovan President Maia Sandu also called for Mr Saakashvili's immediate release; ""Torturing an opposition leader to death is unacceptable for a country that wants to join the European Union,"" she wrote in a tweet. Empathy, an organisation supporting victims of torture in Georgia, alleged on 1 December that Mr Saakashvili had been diagnosed with illnesses ""incompatible with imprisonment"" and that Georgian and foreign medical experts had found evidence of heavy-metal poisoning. On Thursday, the European Parliament debated Mr Saakashvili's health, where the European Commissioner for Budget and Administration, Johannes Hahn, said the Georgian government was obliged to provide him appropriate healthcare. Late last year, Mr Saakashvili gave French President Emmanuel Macron a hand-written note reading: ""SOS. I am dying, I have very little time left."" Georgian authorities have said Mr Saakasvhili is feigning his condition to secure a release from prison. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The Indian Ocean nation defaulted on its sovereign debt in May 2022, plunging the country into economic and political chaos. The Colombo government secured a $2.9bn (Â£2.4bn) International Monetary Fund bailout in principle the following September. But the cash will not be released to Sri Lanka until its sovereign creditors in China and India first agree to a restructuring of the billions of dollars of bilateral debt they are owed. Despite optimism over the past month that such an agreement was imminent, a deal has still not materialised - and Sri Lanka's economic agony, and the suffering of its population, continues. Yet, even if the bailout cash does start to flow in the coming weeks or months, that will not mark the end of Sri Lanka's economic rebuilding programme, but merely the beginning. For it's widely accepted that Sri Lanka's economic model needs a fundamental overhaul. In the years following the savage end of the government's 25-year war against the separatist Tamil Tigers in 2009, Sri Lanka benefited from something of a financial ""peace dividend"". The government at the time successfully attracted large flows of foreign investment, not only from foreign governments like China, but also private international bondholders. These financial flows pumped up domestic economic growth, but at the cost of ballooning imbalances.  The domestic economy grew steadily less internationally competitive in these years. And while exports continued to rise from 2000 to 2018, from $6.5bn to $19.4bn, over the same time period they slumped as a share of the economy, from 39% to 23%.  Even before the pandemic hit in 2020, tearing the heart out of the island's lucrative tourism industry, the Sri Lankan trade deficit - the gap between its imports and exports - was already running at more than 6% of GDP. That imbalance is one of the reasons the default hit Sri Lanka so hard - it suddenly found itself without the means to generate the foreign currency needed to import vital supplies of food and fuel. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who took over the presidency after the discredited and reviled Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in July 2022, has been clear that Sri Lanka's road to recovery will have to involve addressing the imbalance at source, and, in particular, driving up exports. ""We have to transform into a highly competitive export-oriented economy,"" he told local business leaders last year. ""There is no other way out. We are a country with 22 million people. We have to find markets outside."" So the big economic question looming over Sri Lanka is: can this be done? Can the country trade its way back to prosperity? Traditionally, Sri Lanka's big exports have been agricultural, starting with cinnamon, which attracted European colonisers in the 16th Century. Today tea is still the biggest export commodity. But the tea sector is still reeling from a disastrous 2021 ban on imports of fertiliser by the previous government, which cut yields by a fifth. Looking to the future, increasing agricultural productivity is an obvious avenue for policymakers to explore. Yet many firms in the tea sector style themselves as ""artisan"" producers, with leaves still plucked by hand as they were two centuries ago when the plantations were started by the British Empire. And many estates are still using archaic processing equipment. On top of this, Roshan Rajadurai, the general manager of the Pedro estate in Nuwara Eliya, says that its workers are resistant to new, more efficient methods of picking. He wants to move to a model in which pickers and their families are given individual sections of plantation to harvest themselves - with them setting their own hours - rather than working in large traditional work teams for fixed daily hours. It's a reform Mr Rajadurai says has been proven to increase yields where it has been adopted, but he says the pickers are resisting. ""If we don't do it I think with the rising cost, and the static prices that we get in the world markets for our product, I don't think we can be sustainable in the long term,"" he warns. Textiles - manufacturing garments for Western brands - are another major source of exports for Sri Lanka.  But this, even more than tea, relies heavily on imported raw materials and fuel, which have shot up in price in the wake of the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Those prices should come down this year, yet the reality is that tea and textiles, though they will probably always be important, are unlikely to push Sri Lanka very far up the global export value chain. So what else could Sri Lanka export? What's striking is that speaking to policymakers and analysts in Sri Lanka, as Newsnight did in January, is that there is very little sense of a grand plan. Unlike other Asian nations such as Malaysia or Vietnam, which saw a major state-led push into electronic manufacturing, there's no strong sense that one hears of a particular sector where the country can and should gain an advantage. The closest area to a prospective national champion is probably port services.  The governor of the county's central bank, Nandalal Weerasinghe, says Sri Lanka's geographical location, in the centre of Indian Ocean shipping lanes, offers an opportunity to be a major ""trans-shipment"" hub. ""Ports and logistics are where there is the potential for us to promote exports,"" he says. It is estimated that a third of the world's bulk cargo, and two-thirds of its oil, is transported across the Indian Ocean. But perhaps the absence of a clear national plan doesn't matter as much as getting the economic policymaking basics right. In the grip of the crisis last year, the government removed a peg on the currency, which resulted in a halving of the value of the rupee against the US dollar. Some think keeping a floating exchange rate will ultimately help boost exports. ""[In the past] we didn't allow it to depreciate or to adjust according to market forces, which has basically discouraged exports,"" says Roshan Perera of the Advocata think tank, and a former central bank director. Another area for reform identified by the World Bank is, ironically, liberalising imports and dismantling tariffs. These duties make many imported goods and products more expensive, thereby benefiting domestic producers,  such as those in the retail and construction sectors. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade. Sri Lanka is reckoned to be one of the most protected economies in the world in terms of import duties on consumer goods. The argument is that liberalisation could attract more foreign investment, which will help the country's industries become more efficient and export more. The question is whether, despite the change of president last year, there is enough political space for Mr Wickremesinghe to dismantle trade barriers, which will inevitably attract opposition from powerful local vested interests. The optimistic case is that the shock of the last year will provide an impetus for such painful reforms, and give Sri Lanka at least a fighting chance of trading its way out of its worst ever economic crisis.

Vice-President Kamala Harris, speaking at the funeral, said it is now non-negotiable that Congress must pass the George Floyd policing act. The bill aims to increase police accountability.  The legislation has been stalled in Congress where it cannot get enough Republican votes to pass. But the death of Tyre Nichols has revived efforts to reach a bipartisan compromise. President Joe Biden has vowed to sign it, if it comes to his desk. Many people I spoke to in Memphis told me they had not watched the harrowing police videos that show Mr Nichols being kicked, punched and hit with a baton while lying on the ground. They said they didn't need to watch the tapes to know how the police behave in their city. And few were surprised that it was black officers who killed Mr Nichols. Amber Sherman has been campaigning for police reform in Memphis for years. She says black police officers are not immune from the institutionalised racism she sees in the police force. ""The system of policing is inherently white supremacist, racist and anti-black,"" she says. ""And so the fact that someone who is black joins that system doesn't mean that they're going to remember that they're black, or they're going to put that first. ""They put being an officer firstâ¦ And then what happens is black folks have these people attacking them regardless of looking like them."" I met Mark Jackson at the makeshift memorial that's been erected on the spot where Mr Nichols was killed. He'd brought a small red skateboard with Mr Nichols' name written across it to place beside the flowers and teddy bears already arranged around a white cross. He told me he fears that he or his 16-year-old son could be assaulted by the police at any time simply because they are black. And they don't feel any safer dealing with black officers. ""They would have never beat a white man like they beat Tyre,"" he told me. ""The perception is we have less value, we probably have less legal standing. And they probably felt they would get away with it."" After every tragic police killing there are the same calls for action and reform. Rarely does significant change occur. Mr Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, is urging lawmakers to act this time, saying if they don't ""the next child that dies - that blood is going to be on their hands"". She wants a new law that would compel police to intervene if their fellow officers are assaulting a suspect. The veteran civil rights campaigner, the Rev Al Sharpton, delivered the eulogy for Tyre Nichols and led the demands for justice for him and the other unarmed black people who have died at the hands of the police. I asked him if he really believes Mr Nichols' alleged murder will bring about the changes to the law. ""Change doesn't just drop out the sky,"" he told me.  ""It comes from the ground up we got to keep fighting."" Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

He is also gay, and sees no conflict between his sexuality and religion.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64496456,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1566D/production/_128516678_weddingday.jpg,2023-02-05T01:34:20Z,"Jasvir Singh is one of the most prominent Sikh voices in British public life. He is also gay - a fact that he has kept mostly private until now. It's put him at odds with some members of his own community, but he says he now wants to speak up about his sexuality.  Jasvir Singh lays out some photographs on the table in front of him and takes a deep breath. They are pictures of joyful moments from the day last summer when he married his husband, Nick. ""I know that speaking about this is going to be highly controversial,"" he says. ""I'm sure there will be lots of people out there who will be upset, annoyed, even angry at me. ""But I've got nothing to hide and I know that I have got Waheguru [God] with me, as I have had Waheguru with me all the way.""  Jasvir is a family law barrister and the main Sikh contributor to Radio 4's Thought For The Day. He has just been awarded a CBE for his work bringing faith communities together and advocating for vulnerable groups. But through it all, he has lived with a swirl of speculation about his private life - often spilling over into attempts at intimidation - that he now wants to address head-on. ""There is a very small element of the British Sikh community that makes itself loudly heard. From them I have received death threats for being gay, I have been accused on a TV station of being an infidel and I have even had individuals call me up and threaten to expose me.""  Though Jasvir says he has not tried to hide his sexual orientation, it is not something he has talked about publicly.  After a video from his wedding recently started being shared on social media, he felt the time was right to speak up. He wanted to tell his story on his own terms, and also to send a message to gay Sikhs facing difficulties. ""Just as my Sikhism is part of me, so is my sexuality. So is my turban. So is my identity. I can't divorce any one thing from the rest of me. That is who I am."" Jasvir says that the Sikh religion in which he grew up within his family, was very focused on a central tenet of equality, and says he has never felt his faith to be in conflict with his homosexuality. He points to a pivotal moment when he was 16 years old. ""I was waiting for my GCSE results and went on a pilgrimage to India. With my dad, I trekked three or four days to a place called Hemkund Sahib, a beautiful idyllic gurdwara [Sikh temple] in the Himalayas.  ""After the arduous journey, I paid my respects but the one thing I prayed for was to be straight. I just wanted to be able to live a life where I did not embarrass people, and where my family would not be ashamed of me."" Jasvir says that because his sexual orientation did not change after the pilgrimage, he began to feel that this was the way that had been laid out for him by Waheguru. It gave him the confidence to start coming out to friends.  Though many Sikhs see things differently, Jasvir says he never saw any conflict in the religion's teachings and scripture between his faith and his sexual orientation. The Guru Granth Sahib, the core Sikh religious text, does not refer to homosexuality at all, but it does make mention of husbands and wives.  It also speaks of an all-pervading divine spirit and seeing that spirit in everyone irrespective of race or class or gender. This has allowed Sikhs on different sides of the debate to point to scripture as backing up their own position on homosexuality and on same-sex unions. Recently, however, Jasvir says he has been confronted by an unsurmountable obstacle that meant he could not live out his faith in the way in which he wanted and in the way others can.  ""My husband is white, British, and was not born into a Sikh family. But he understands my Sikhi (Sikhism) and he has respected and embraced that part of my life. We have said we want to have a family and want to bring our children up Sikh. ""We spoke about the kind of wedding we wanted in great detail, but sadly there was no way of getting married in a gurdwara, even though in my interpretation of the Anand Karaj (the Sikh marriage ceremony), there is no reason for this."" Sikh organising bodies in the UK and elsewhere see things very differently. In 2005, the Sikh religious leadership of the Akal Takht at the Golden Temple in Amritsar in Punjab, restated the position that same-sex marriage was unacceptable. ""From a faith perspective the position remains rock solid. The Anand Karaj ceremony is only for heterosexual couples,"" says Gurmel Singh, secretary-general of the Supreme Sikh Council in the UK, a representative body of British Sikhs and Sikh places of worship. Gurmel Singh says that he knows and respects Jasvir as a Sikh advocate, but that even in a fast-evolving society, the fundamental doctrines of the faith will not change to allow him to marry a man in a gurdwara. But Jasvir recounts a moment which he interprets as acceptance from a Sikh religious figure that deeply touched him. It happened with his fiancÃ© in a gurdwara in the UK in the run up to his civil marriage last year. ""We went to offer blessings and had taken in a rumalla, a cloth used to cover the scriptures. The granthi, the custodian of the scriptures, saw us come in together and said he would say the ardas [prayers] for us. ""The granthi asked if there was anything in particular we wanted him to pray for, and we just said, for our wellbeing. But he asked if we were absolutely sure there was nothing else we wanted him to pray for. It was then I realised he had noticed that we both had mehndi [henna] on our hands which is often done in the run-up to getting married. ""He said the ardas and it was not just for our wellbeing, it was for the coming together of our two families. It was so powerful for me and for the two of us.""  Jasvir and Nick have just returned from their honeymoon, during which they visited gurdwaras in Punjab and in other parts of India. Given that the overwhelming majority of Sikhs have origins in Punjab, Jasvir feels edicts made by the faith's religious leaders are heavily influenced by Punjabi culture over scripture, though that is denied by UK Sikh bodies. ""Sadly I know gay Sikhs who have given up their faith, or who feel their only option was to cut their hair, and to become less faithful, or just focus on their inner faith rather than spend time at the gurdwara."" Though he is himself leader of a progressive Sikh organisation in the UK, there are those in the faith community here who do not consider Jasvir a true practising Sikh, but one who wears a turban and follows some aspects of Sikhism. ""My faith has been a constant in my life through good times and bad. I'm not going to waver from my faith but I'm also not going to be ashamed of my sexuality,"" Jasvir says. Part of Jasvir's reason for speaking out is also because he says he had never had gay Sikh role models, particularly couples and those who considered themselves to be religious. But he also recognises that he has been relatively privileged. ""Sadly I have seen some Sikhs who have come out to their family members who have been kicked out of their homes, who have been beaten, who have been called paedophiles, and have had so much thrown at them.  ""When they see that done by family members wearing turbans they associate that image with their faith. They may even be unable to speak openly to someone who's wearing a turban because of what they've experienced.""  Jasvir hopes that by speaking out, he will encourage others to be proud of who they are.  He says that in the UK, Sikh society is moving towards more acceptance and understanding, and while he is expecting some backlash for speaking up, he is also hoping to be pleasantly surprised by some.  ""When that wedding video was leaked and maliciously spread around social media, it was the way one of my elderly relatives found out I was gay,"" he says. ""She is in her nineties but she said to another family member, 'As long as he is happy, I am happy' - something we all could learn from.""

The first earthquake, which struck in the early hours of 6 February, was registered as 7.8, classified as ""major"" on the official magnitude scale. Its epicentre was near Gaziantep - a city of more than two million people. The intensity of the tremors also brought down tower blocks and public buildings in northern Syria and the quake was felt as far away as Cyprus and Lebanon, both about 250 miles (400km) from the epicentre. In Turkey, more than 8,500 people are confirmed to have died, with tens of thousands injured and thousands of buildings destroyed. The first earthquake was followed by numerous aftershocks, including one quake which was almost as large as the first - registering as magnitude 7.5 - about nine hours later with its epicentre about 60 miles (100km) further north in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province. On Tuesday, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared a three month state of emergency in the south-east of the country, covering 10 cities affected. In the Mediterranean port city of Iskenderun, in the province of Hatay, about 75 miles (120km) from Gaziantep, buildings and docks were reduced to rubble. A fire at the port of Iskenderun has also hampered aid efforts with many containers destroyed and those stuck in the port blocking supplies being brought in. The historic Yeni Camii mosque, in Malatya, more than 100 miles (160km) from the epicentre, was extensively damaged. Its domes collapsed, leaving it exposed to the winter sky. The mosque was destroyed by a huge earthquake in 1894 and, after reconstruction, damaged by another quake in 1964. Collapsing buildings killed more than 2,500 people across Syria. In the city of Aleppo, the ancient citadel ravaged by a decade of war has been further damaged by the quake.  In the village of Besnaya-Bseineh, a large block of residential and commercial buildings was reduced to rubble.  Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The 19-month-old child fell down the 13m (42ft) deep shaft while playing on Monday afternoon in Tak province, near the Myanmar border.  Authorities launched an overnight rescue operation after the girl's parents - who had been working in a nearby field - raised the alarm.  She was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries, officials said.  ""She has signs of fatigue but still has good vital signs,"" local police chief Ratsaran Ketsoising told AFP. Panic was sparked after the baby girl - who is said to be the daughter of two Myanmarese migrants - fell through a 30cm (12in) wide gap at the top of the well.  The baby's parents said they had taken her to work with them at a tapioca farm in the Khiri Rat sub-district. They said they had left her under a tree while they worked.  But they raised the alarm after they were unable to find the child during their break and heard cries coming from the nearby well.  Rescue teams were forced to work through the night using a mechanical digger, with which they dug a 10m deep pit adjacent to the well shaft.  Oxygen was pumped into the well to allow the child to breathe. Images at the scene showed rescue workers in hard hats working at the bottom of a deep pit. But authorities told local media that they feared that the well could collapse in on itself and harm the child if they continued to use the digger, so they used hand-held shovels to remove the final few metres of earth.  PBS Thailand reported that rescue workers reached the child at about 08:00 local time (01:00 GMT), but were unable to pull her out immediately, as she appeared to have suffered an injury to her leg.  However, cheers erupted shortly afterwards from the assembled rescue workers after the girl was finally pulled from the well.  ""We are so glad we could rescue her safely,"" rescue worker Chanachart Wancharernrung told reporters. ""We have been trying since yesterday afternoon. We worked without sleep. Everyone helped out.""

The ex-military ruler, who was president from 2001-2008, died in Dubai on Sunday after a long illness, and his body was repatriated to Pakistan. The prayers took place at a military compound in Karachi, but senior figures were notably absent, including the army chief and Pakistan's current president. He was a key US ally during its ""war on terror"" but had a complicated legacy. An estimated 10,000 people attended the prayers, mainly retired and serving military officers, AFP news agency reported.   A junior army officer at the site who asked not to be named said a gun salute was given to the former leader. Neither the army chief, prime minister or president were there, but local media reported that some politicians and former army chiefs attended. Some locals felt Musharraf did not receive the send off he deserved, with one telling AFP that his funeral should have been held at the national stadium. Another, a retired government official, said ""thousands of people wanted to participate in the funeral but no details were provided"". Musharraf's body was later transported to a nearby military graveyard where the coffin, draped in the national flag, was buried as hundreds of people watched surrounded by tight security. In a statement, Pakistan's powerful military expressed its ""heartfelt condolences"", while President Arif Alvi prayed ""for eternal rest of the departed soul"". General Musharraf was born in Delhi in August 1943, but his family joined millions of other Muslims in the newly created Pakistan, following the partition of India in 1947 after British rule ended.  He entered the Pakistan Military Academy in 1962, serving in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, and throughout his career had a ""love-hate"" relationship with neighbouring India.  As the head of the armed forces, General Musharraf seized power in a bloodless coup in October 1999, before formally appointing himself as president two years later.  As Pakistan's leader at the time of the United States' ""war on terror"" in the wake of the 11 September terror attacks in 2001, Musharraf controversially supported the American-led military campaign to oust the Taliban regime in neighbouring Afghanistan, who had harboured Muslim radicals blamed for the attacks. In January 2002, he issued a strong condemnation of extremism, pledging to fight Islamist terrorism in Pakistan.  This pro-Western agenda angered many militants at home, and there were several assassination attempts made against him.  In 2008 he suffered defeat in the polls and left the country six months later. He was embroiled in a number of court cases following his loss of power, including accusations of failing to provide adequate security for former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, whose assassination by the Taliban in 2007 sent shockwaves around the world. Musharraf's career ultimately ended in disgrace, when he was sentenced to death in absentia for treason in 2019. Though that sentencing was later reversed, he never returned to Pakistan. An editorial in Dawn, Pakistan's largest English-language daily, said Musharraf leaves behind ""a mixed legacy"", and that while he navigated some difficult times around the events of 9/11, his actions also ""set Pakistan back several years"".  ""It should be left to history to judge him,"" it said.  Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

Ramcharitmanas is counted by many scholars to be among the world's greatest literary creations. Celebrated author Pavan Varma calls it ""a deeply philosophical work"" which ""is akin to the Bible for many Hindus"".  Composed by Tulsidas, the poem is a retelling of Ramayana, the Sanskrit epic written by Hindu sage Valmiki 2,500 years ago. It's widely believed that Tulsidas's version, which is written in Awadhi - a dialect very similar to Hindi - is what made Ram's story accessible to the masses and why it became so popular. The story of the crown prince of Ayodhya and his victory over the demon king Ravana is performed every year during the Dussehra festival across India. He is a god who's revered by millions of Hindus for his sense of justice and fair play. But in the past few weeks, politicians on opposing sides have been arguing over whether the text is derogatory towards women as well as Dalits, who are at the bottom of India's deeply discriminatory caste system. This is not the first time Tulsidas's epic, written more than 600 years ago, has been criticised, but what sets it apart this time is the scale of protests by both its supporters and critics. General elections in India are due in a year and politicians from both sides accuse each other of using the controversy over the book to polarise voters along caste lines.  Since January, protesters have burned pages allegedly containing excerpts from the book - and counter-protests have been held, demanding critics of the work be arrested. At least five people, accused of desecrating the sacred text, have been arrested and, at the weekend, police invoked the National Security Act (NSA), a draconian law that makes bail nearly impossible, against two of the arrested men. Trouble started in January when a minister in the northern state of Bihar said the book was ""spreading hatred in society"". At a gathering of university students, Education Minister Chandrashekhar (who uses only one name) recited a few lines from Ramcharitmanas to prove his point. ""It says that if people from lower castes receive education, they become poisonous, like a snake becomes after drinking milk,"" he said. A few days later, Swami Prasad Maurya, a prominent leader of a socially-disadvantaged community known as Other Backward Classes (OBC) and a member of the regional Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh state, expressed similar sentiments.  Insisting that some verses of Ramcharitmanas were ""offensive"", he demanded that they be removed from the book.  ""Why hurl abuse in the name of religion? I respect all religions. But if in the name of religion, a community or caste is humiliated then it is objectionable,"" The Indian Express quoted him as saying. On Wednesday, he tweeted a letter he's written to the prime minister and the president of India, asking them to ""remove the objectionable comments, which are abusive and insulting towards women, tribals, Dalits and backwards"". The comments by Mr Chandrasekhar, whose Rashtriya Janata Dal party governs Bihar, and Mr Maurya set off a political firestorm with Hindu nationalist groups, including members from India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticising them.  BJP politician Nandkishore Gurjar said he had written to the Supreme Court demanding the death penalty for Mr Maurya. In the temple town of Ayodhya a prominent Hindu seer demanded the Bihar minister apologise and be sacked.  In Uttar Pradesh, protesters burnt effigies of Mr Maurya and lodged a police complaint, demanding his arrest. Soon, groups supporting Mr Maurya also joined in. At a protest by members of the Akhil Bharatiya OBC Mahasabha in his support in the city of Lucknow, some pages containing excerpts from Ramcharitmanas were burned - the five men who were arrested had participated in this protest. The controversy has also renewed a debate around Ramcharitmanas and whether the criticism has any merit in a country where the constitution sets out that all Indians are equal. Feminists have decried it over the years, especially lines that say that ""a drum, an uneducated man, a Dalit and a woman, all need to be beaten or reprimanded"".  Prof Hemlata Mahishwar of Delhi's Jamia University told BBC Hindi that ""it's not just one or two lines but there are several verses"" in Ramcharitmanas that are derogatory to women and Dalits. ""There's one couplet that says that a Brahmin is to be worshipped even if he's full of bad qualities. Whereas a Dalit, even if he's a Vedic scholar, cannot be respected. So how can we accept a book that's so biased?""  Some experts, however, say that Tulsidas was not a reformer and did have his biases, but the controversial lines are spoken by his characters and can't be taken to be a reflection of the author's opinion. Akhilesh Shandilya, an expert on Ramcharitmanas, told BBC Hindi that the lines appear derogatory to Dalits and anti-women only when taken out of context and read in isolation.  But critics say that Ramcharitmanas has to be approached in the present-day context and deserves scrutiny and discussion, especially as it is a book that has such a hold on the imagination of Indians.

In a statement, her parents said they were ""devastated and deeply shocked"". Matt and Sophie Berry said their daughter was a ""vibrant and happy girl"" who loved the water and art. ""She was a caring person and was a dear friend to many... a beautiful and loving big sister and the best daughter we could have hoped for."" One of her friends, Lara Connolly, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Stella was the ""sweetest and smartest girl that I knew"". ""She was so kind,"" Lara said. Authorities are investigating what type of shark was involved, but the WA Fisheries Minister has said it was ""likely"" a bull shark. The government will consider what could be done to prevent any similar incidents, Don Punch said. ""Shark barriers is something we're always open to talking to local government about."" Fisheries experts say it is unusual to find sharks in that part of the Swan River, and the attack is the first fatal one along the river in 100 years. Historically, dying from a shark bite is not common. In more than a century of records, Australia's shark attack mortality rate is 0.9 - less than one person per year. There were two fatal shark attacks in 2021, and seven in 2020. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

The suspects are accused of falsely offering jobs to 28 people who were tricked into counting trains for weeks. Police began investigating the scam last November. The victims paid between 200,000 rupees ($2,400; Â£2,000) and 2.4m rupees each to secure jobs as ticket examiners, traffic assistants or clerks. Indian Railways is one of the world's largest employers. Scams for government jobs are often reported in India, where millions of young people are desperate for stable, secure employment. The two men arrested, Sivaraman V and Vikas Rana, are accused of being part of a gang that allegedly asked the victims, who are from southern Tamil Nadu state, to stand at different platforms of the main railway station in India's capital Delhi for eight hours every day for about a month. Police said that Rana, who is from Delhi, used to work at the National Museum of Natural History but left his job in March last year. Sivaraman V lives in Tamil Nadu, the Times of India newspaper reported.  The accused allegedly asked the victims to count the trains that passed through the station every day, the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency reported. One of the victims had told the Indian Express newspaper that he was looking for opportunities to support his family after the Covid-19 pandemic.  Police were alerted to the scam by Subbuswamy, a former army official who said that he unknowingly put the victims in touch with the accused.  He told PTI that he had been helping the young men from his hometown in Tamil Nadu's Virudhunagar district find jobs ""without any monetary interest"" for himself. He said he met a person called Sivaraman who claimed to have connections with lawmakers and ministers and offered to find government jobs for the unemployed men. The accused then put Subbuswamy and the victims in touch with another man, who even took the candidates for fake medical examinations. The man later stopped answering phone calls from them. Some of the victims said they borrowed money to pay the scammers. The accused are in police custody and have made no statement since their arrest. Â© 2023 BBC.

What do you hear when you think of the Arctic and Antarctic?  ""Singing"" ice, a seal that sounds like it is in space, and a seismic airgun thundering like a bomb are some of the noises released by two marine acoustic labs. The project introduces the public to 50 rarely heard sounds recorded underwater in the polar regions. It highlights how noisy oceans are becoming due to increased human activity that also disrupts sea life. ""These sounds are fairly alien to most people,"" explains artist and researcher Dr Geraint Rhys Whittaker. ""We probably think we know what the poles sound like but often that is imagined,"" adds Dr Whittaker, who works at the Helmholtz Institute for Functional Marine Biodiversity and the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany. The underwater microphones were attached to floats with scientific instruments left in the Arctic and Antarctic for about two years.  One sound captured was calls from the least-researched Antarctic seal. Ross seals live in the open seas and on pack ice that is difficult to reach. The scientists recorded five calls from the creature of different frequencies. Crabeater seals, minke whales, narwhals and humpback whales were also recorded. It can be hard to capture these sounds due to the inhospitable environment and the vast distances that animals travel in the regions. ""The difficulty is knowing where the mammals will be because they move and you can't rely on where they will be,"" explains Dr Whittaker. The roaring collapse of ice shelves was also recorded, a process that is being accelerated in parts of the polar regions by rising temperatures linked to climate change. The delicate sound of ice ""singing"" is included in the collection. It is caused by ice moving in water, or contracting as temperatures rise and fall, or when ice melts and refreezes. Few people read scientific research published by universities, Dr Whittaker suggests, and he hopes that listening to the sounds will make people stop and think about the polar oceans. Oceans occupy 71% of our planet's surface and are hugely important for preserving life on Earth but are severely impacted by climate change.  Temperatures in the Arctic are rising four times faster than other parts of the world. The microphones also picked up human-made noise in the oceans, caused by shipping and oil and gas exploration.  Noise pollution from seismic blasting, used to explore the seabed, travels huge distances and scientists have found it negatively affects animal life. The project reveals just how noisy the oceans are, suggests Dr Whittaker, who says he hopes it highlights the need for laws to reduce noise from shipping and dredging damaging marine life. Working with the sound-art project Cities and Memory, the noises have also been turned into more than 100 compositions put together by musicians highlighting climate change.  ""With Earth's poles warming faster than the global average, this collection of sounds aims to draw attention to a fascinating but rapidly changing environment, and encourages us to think about ways to preserve it for future generations,"" explains Stuart Fowkes, founder of Cities and Memory. Dr Ilse van Opzeeland, from the Ocean Acoustics Group at Alfred Wegener Institute, hopes combining art and science will help raise awareness. ""A 'translation' through art breathes new life into our scientific data that goes beyond a traditional publication or policy paper by making it accessible to non-scientists,"" she said. ""We must make the greatest efforts to protect, conserve and restore our planet's endangered habitats. The interaction of art and science can help by creating awareness and brings attention to this."" Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Darren Edwards from Shropshire started in Antarctica on 31 January and is due to finish in Florida on Tuesday. The former Army reservist is taking part in the World Marathon Challenge which also visits South Africa, Australia, Dubai, Brazil and Spain. He said he did not want to let his disability prevent him from ""dreaming big and taking on tough challenges"". Mr Edwards, from West Felton, suffered a life-changing spinal cord injury while mountain climbing in 2016. He had been preparing to start a job as a history teacher when he was injured in North Wales, leaving him paralysed from his chest down. But he said since then he had ""been on a journey of rediscovery"". Mr Edwards is raising money for the Armed Forces Para-Snowsport Team, a charity that supports wounded, injured and sick military personnel. He said he had crossed over 18 time zones and spanned the globe in just 168 hours. The first marathon, in Antarctica, was ""the most challenging five hours, 50 minutes of my life,"" he said. He battled high winds, freezing temperatures and snow drifts, but said it was also the most rewarding time of his life too as got to experience ""the raw beauty and majesty of the world's most southerly continent"". In the ""hot and windy"" sunshine in South Africa, he managed to cross the finish line first, with a time of two hours and 48 minutes. He said it was probably the first time he had won anything in his life. His race in Perth, Australia, was completed in the ""blazing afternoon heat"" in two hours and 36 minutes and he said he got to see a ""breath-taking sunset with shades of purple and deep orange"". After completing his fourth marathon in Dubai in another personal best time, he said: ""I am beginning to realise that I am capable of more than I often give myself credit for."" He described Madrid as a ""gruelling marathon today on the rutted streets"" and said it was particularly challenging because he had to repeat the same loop 33 times.

The singer will perform during the break when the Philadelphia Eagles take on the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. Rihanna has not toured or released an album since 2016's Anti. The star has instead focused on her fashion brand, and last year welcomed her first child. However, she did record a new song last year for Marvel's Wakanda Forever.  Lift Me Up, which features on the soundtrack to the Black Panther sequel, marked Rihanna's first new solo single for six years and has been nominated for an Oscar. Fans hope that the 34-year-old's Super Bowl performance could signal a bigger musical comeback later this year. The singer said on Thursday it was initially ""scary"" to accept the invitation and take on one of music's biggest stages. ""I haven't been on stage for seven years,"" she said, speaking at a press conference ahead of the big game.  But she said that it was important to her to be ""representing for immigrants, representing for my country, Barbados, representing for black women everywhere"".  The Super Bowl is the annual final playoff game of the National Football League (NFL), to determine the league champion. This year, the Philadelphia Eagles will face the Kansas City Chiefs at the State Farm Stadium in Arizona. The Super Bowl LVII (the Roman numerals signify this is the 57th year) will take place on Sunday 12 February, with kick-off at 23:30 GMT (18:30 ET/16:30 MST). The game usually lasts about three-and-a-half hours, with a 30-minute break in the middle, which is where an A-list pop star is hired to keep the crowds entertained. UK viewers can watch the game and half-time show live on ITV1 and the recently-launched streaming service ITVX, with coverage beginning at 22:45 GMT. It is also being shown on Sky Sports, starting at 22:00. There will be live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, and live text on the BBC Sport website and app, which will also have post-match video highlights. In the US, it will air on Fox, and also be streamed on the Fox Sports website and app, the NFL+ app, as well as Hulu, fuboTV, Roku TV and Sling TV. Rihanna won't be the only star involved in the Super Bowl proceedings. Coda star Troy Kotsur, who won an Oscar last year for his performance in the Apple TV film, will sign US national anthem this year. Nobody knows for sure which songs will make the cut. Half-time show set lists and a performer's special guests are shrouded in secrecy to ensure fans are surprised on the night.  ""The setlist was the biggest challenge,"" Rihanna told Apple Music on Thursday. ""You're trying to cram 17 years of work into 13 minutes."" But the star should be able to squeeze in quite a few of her many hits, particularly as performers often play only short snippets of some songs so they can cover more of their back catalogue. Speculating about the possible song list is part of the fun for fans. Gossip outlet Deuxmoi quoted a source last week who suggested Rihanna would stick to her older, best-known hits, but added that the set list is being constantly tweaked and polished. At Thursday's press conference, Rihanna confirmed, only half-jokingly, that there are ""about 39 versions of the set list right now"". Half-time performers also often invite very special guests to appear alongside them. Coldplay brought out BeyoncÃ© and Bruno Mars, while Katy Perry hosted Missy Elliott and Lenny Kravitz. But teaming up with other stars can often result the most controversial moments of half-time shows, such as Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson's ""wardrobe malfunction"" and M.I.A.'s choice of hand gesture when she joined Madonna. Headlining the Super Bowl is one of the biggest and most prestigious gigs in music, due to the astronomically large TV audience both in the US and around the world. About 100 million viewers watched last year's Super Bowl in the US alone, while Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Mary J Blige, Kendrick Lamar and 50 Cent's half-time show added a further 160m views on YouTube. In recent years, YouTube has become an increasingly important component of a half-time show's impact. Shakira and Jennifer Lopez, who jointly headlined in 2020, notched up 264m plays of their set - the highest of any half-time show to date. Other headliners at the Super Bowl over the years have included Lady Gaga, Prince, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and Michael Jackson. Given the number of viewers watching, a well-received and hit-heavy performance can have a huge impact on an artist's streaming and sales figures in the weeks following the Super Bowl. Rihanna's return to live performing has prompted speculation that new music from her could finally be on the way. The singer used to churn out one album a year, but took an extended break from music after 2016's Anti, resurfacing only occasionally to work with other artists. Her last genuinely massive hit was 2017's Wild Thoughts, a collaboration with DJ Khaled and and Bryson Tiller, which the trio performed at the following year's Grammy Awards. Since then, she has had her first child with her partner A$AP Rocky and continued to build her fashion and cosmetics brand Fenty.  As a result, music has taken a back seat, but in 2022 she released her first new solo single for six years, Lift Me Up. That has catapulted Rihanna into this year's film awards season. She attended the Golden Globes last month, where the track was nominated, and she is also up for best original song at the Oscars on 12 March. Her absence from the world of music has lasted so long, the huge anticipation for her new album has become something of a running joke. Comedian Jerrod Carmichael recently made light of the situation when he hosted the Golden Globes.  ""I'm going to say something very controversial,"" he said. ""Rihanna, you take all the time you want on that album girl. Don't let these fools on the internet pressure you into nothing."" With files from Brandon Drenon Â© 2023 BBC.

Rearing a son significantly reduced a female killer whale's chance of reproducing in the future.  The energy they need to feed sons appears to compromise their health, leaving them less able to reproduce and raise other young. ""Mothers sacrifice their own food and their own energy,"" said Prof Darren Croft from the University of Exeter.  Orcas remain closely bonded to their families throughout their lives. But while young female offspring become independent in adulthood, males depend on their mothers - even demanding a share of the food that their matriarchs catch.  Prof Croft described it as a ""new insight into the complex social lives and family lives of these amazing animals"". The decades-long study, published in the journal Current Biology, is part of an ongoing mission to understand killer whale family life.  It was made possible by the Center for Whale Research (CWR), which has followed the lives of a population of killer whales, known as the Southern Residents, for more than 40 years.  Since 1976, the CWR has produced a complete census of the Southern Resident population, which enabled biologists to carry out multi-generation studies like this one - disentangling critical social behaviour and family bonds that directly impact the animals' survival. For this research, scientists examined the lives of 40 female orcas between 1982 and 2021, and discovered that for each living son, a mother's annual likelihood of rearing another calf to one year old was cut by half. ""Our previous research has shown that sons have a higher chance of survival if their mother is around,"" said Dr Michael Weiss from the University of Exeter and Center for Whale Research.  ""We wanted to find out if this help comes at a price and answer is yes. Killer whale mothers pay a high cost in terms of their future reproduction to keep their sons alive."" The ongoing study of this threatened killer whale population, that lives in the coastal waters between Vancouver and Seattle, was started by Dr Ken Balcomb. Initially, he wanted to examine the threats to their survival. The ensuing work went on to reveal insights into killer whale life that could only have come to light through decades of study.  Biologists have worked with the CWR to reveal, for example, the vital role of killer whale grandmothers and why, like humans, females of this species cease reproduction part way through their lives.  From their years of studying killer whale interactions, scientists already knew that mothers and sons ""hung out"" together well into the male's adulthood. ""They'll even feed their sons salmon they catch,"" explained Prof Croft, whereas adult female offspring will hunt independently. This could, the researchers think, be a kind of evolutionary ""bet-hedging"", driven by the fact that the biggest, oldest males go on to father many offspring.  ""If a mother can get their son to become that big male in the population, then he's the one that will sire [much of the next generation],"" explained Prof Croft.  It may seem paradoxical that such powerful, intelligent animals remain dependent on their mothers through their lives, but it appears that males simply don't have to become independent, because their mother remains by their side.  ""If my mother cooked my dinner for me every night, perhaps I just wouldn't learn to cook my own dinner,"" joked Prof Croft.   ""But, indirectly, it does seem to be in a mother's interest."" This video can not be played The killer whales struggling to feed themselves There are currently just 73 of these killer whales left, so the scientists say they need to understand anything that could help inform decisions about how to protect these marine mammals.  ""These southern resident killer whales are balancing on a knife-edge and at risk of extinction,"" said Prof Croft. ""So anything that reduces females' reproduction is a concern for this population.""

Their identities were released by police on Tuesday. Five others who were injured in Monday night's attack remain in a critical condition.  All of the victims were students at the university, police said. Arielle Diamond Anderson, 19, had dreams of becoming a paediatric surgeon. ""She was working diligently to graduate from Michigan State University early to achieve her goals as quickly as possible,"" her family said in a statement, adding that she ""was sweet and loving with an infectious smile that was very contagious"".

We will greatly miss Brian and mourn his death deeply as our chapter supports each other during this difficult time."" Jennifer Mancini had just spent the past year helping her daughter heal from a traumatic high school shooting in Oxford, Michigan when she got a call that her daughter was in the midst of yet another episode of gun violence.  Ms Mancini said her daughter heard the gunshots from across the street. She told her to turn the lights off, lock the door and stay silent.  Meanwhile, Ms Mancini thought: ""I can't believe this is happening again,"" she told the Detroit Free Press. Ms Mancini's daughter, who she declined to name for privacy reasons, was one of several students on the East Lansing campus who witnessed the second school shooting of their lifetime on Monday.  Students who were on campus during the attack described a sense of panic as they jumped out of windows, hid in corners and sprinted out of buildings to avoid the gunman. Another student, Jackie Matthews, said it had been ten years since she witnessed the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newton, Connecticut, which killed 26 people. In a video, the student said she suffers from a chronic lower back injury from crouching in the corner with her classmates to seek shelter during the elementary school attack. ""I am 21 years old,"" the student said in the video. ""The fact that this is the second mass shooting that I have now lived through is incomprehensible."" ""We can no longer just provide love and prayers,"" she added. ""It needs to be legislation... We can no longer allow this to happen."" To Jane Nodland, a 22-year-old nursing student, it sounded like a stampede. ""I thought I was going to die,"" Ms Nodland told the New York Times. ""It sounded like he was right there."" Police have yet to identify a motive. The 43-year-old suspect, Anthony McRae, had no ties to the university and died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. For some students, Monday marked the second time they witnessed school gun violence in less than two years. Ms Mancini said her daughter lost two of her close friends in a shooting at Oxford High School on 30 November 2021, when a 15-year-old killed four students and injured seven people.  Andrea Ferguson's daughter was also on school grounds in Oxford during the shooting, she told local outlet WDIV. She said several of her daughter's friends who survived the Oxford shooting were on the Michigan State University campus on Monday.  ""I never expected in my lifetime to have to experience two school shootings,"" Ms Ferguson said. ""It was like reliving Oxford all over again."" Â© 2023 BBC.

The UN said 11 lorries crossed from Turkey at Bab al-Salameh on Tuesday. Many Syrians are angry over the lack of aid for the war-torn nation especially to rebel areas, after last week's quakes in which more than 41,000 are known to have died in Turkey and Syria. The UN and Syria's government on Monday agreed to use two more crossings. The other one is at al-Rai, also on the Turkish border. The UN said the crossings would initially be open for three months. Two powerful earthquakes struck the south-eastern regions of neighbouring Turkey on 6 February early in the morning, when many people were asleep. Hopes of finding any more survivors are fading. Countries with friendly relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, including Russia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, began flying supplies to government-controlled areas of Syria soon after the tremor. But the opposition-controlled north-west - where some 4.1 million people were relying on humanitarian assistance to survive even before the disaster - received no aid deliveries from the UN via Turkey until Thursday. The UN blamed damage to roads leading to the Bab al-Hawa crossing, which until now was the the only land route the UN Security Council has authorised it to use.  On Tuesday, the Syrian ambassador to the UN, Bassam al-Sabbagh, told the BBC's Radio 4's World Tonight programme that there would be be no discrimination over who was getting relief aid. And he blamed the delay in opening more aid routes on what he called the ""terrorist opposition"" which controls the north-west. In a separate development, an orphaned Syrian baby born under the rubble of her collapsed home after last week's earthquake has been moved to a ""safe location"" by a health authority. The Afrin Health Directorate took the precautionary measure to protect the girl, Aya, from possible kidnapping and adoption fraud, a source told the BBC. On Monday, there was a violent incident at the hospital in the opposition-held region where she was being treated. A male nurse, accompanied by two armed men, allegedly beat the manager.  The head of the health directorate, Dr Ahmad Hajj Hassan, denied claims on social media that it was a foiled attempt to kidnap Aya. Â© 2023 BBC.

The new constitution replaced one drafted soon after the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, which saw Tunisia overthrow late dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.  It gives the head of state full executive control and supreme command of the army. Last month, thousands of protesters rallied in the capital Tunis, demanding the resignation of Mr Saied's government.

Members from the Hampshire & Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service (HIWFRS) brought the pair to safety after a 25-hour long rescue in Hatay. The nine-strong team are among 77 firefighters from the UK assisting with the search and rescue operation.  The UN has said the rescue phase is ""coming to a close"". Footage from UK International Search and Rescue (UK ISAR) showed the team tunnelling for 19 hours after the voice of a woman was heard in a collapsed building in the province, close to the Syrian border.  The quakes are known to have killed almost 40,000 people in the two countries. Rescuer Steve Hartley was among those taking part: ""One of the team members put his hand through some rubble and actually made contact with the casualty and held her hand, passed her water.  ""It then took us a further six hours to then make the void big enough so I had to drag her the first six feet, the other team members were there to support me."" After the woman was brought to safety a man was also pulled from the ruins.  No return date has been finalised for the rescue team, a spokesman for HIWFRS said. In the south-eastern mostly Kurdish city of Adiyaman the Wiltshire-based charity Serve On is working alongside search and rescue experts from across Europe.  The charity has set up its makeshift base on a university campus. Volunteer Dan Cooke said: ""The death toll is rising, it's high. Most of the jobs don't involve these moments where people have survived.  ""It's still our job to keep going through that space, even if it is sadly just confirming there's still a lot of loss and tragedy."" The UN has said the search and rescue phase of this operation is ""coming to a close"" as officials turn their attention to providing survivors with shelter, food and healthcare.

Now, she can only leave home to go to court.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64625127,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9A89/production/_128616593_capture.jpg,2023-02-14T17:11:30Z,"University student Olesya Krivtsova has been missing a lot of classes. That's because 20-year-old Olesya is under house arrest. She has an electronic tag on her leg. Police can monitor her every move.  Her alleged crime? Olesya was arrested for anti-war posts on social media. One of them concerned last October's explosion on the bridge linking Russia to annexed Crimea. ""I posted an Instagram story about the bridge,"" Olesya tells the BBC, ""reflecting on how Ukrainians were happy with what had happened.""  She had also shared a friend's post about the war. Then the drama began. ""I was talking on the phone to my mother,"" Olesya recalls, ""when I heard the front door opening. Lots of police came in. They took away my phone and shouted at me to lie on the floor."" Olesya was charged with justifying terrorism and discrediting the Russian armed forces. She faces up to 10 years in prison. ""I never imagined anyone could get such a long prison sentence for posting something on the internet,"" Olesya says. ""I'd seen reports of crazy verdicts in Russia, but I hadn't paid much attention and continued to speak out."" A student of the Northern Federal University in Arkhangelsk, Olesya has now been added to Russia's official list of terrorists and extremists.  ""When I realised I'd been put on the same list as school shooters and the Islamic State group I thought it was crazy,"" recalls Olesya.  Under the rules of her house arrest she's banned from talking on the phone and going online. Olesya has a striking image tattooed on her right leg - Russian President Vladimir Putin depicted as a spider, with an Orwellian inscription: ""Big Brother is watching you."" It appears that in Olesya's case, it wasn't Big Brother watching her, but her fellow students. ""A friend showed me a post about me in a chat,"" Olesya says, ""about how I was against the 'special military operation'. Most of the people in this chat were history students. They were discussing whether to denounce me to the authorities."" The BBC has seen extracts from the group chat. In one comment, Olesya is accused of writing ""provocative posts of a defeatist and extremist character. This is out of place for war-time. It must be nipped in the bud"".  ""First let's try to discredit her. If she doesn't get it, let the security services deal with it."" ""Denunciation is the duty of a patriot,"" someone else writes. Later, when the list of prosecution witnesses was read out in court, Olesya recognised the names from the student chat. It's one year since the Kremlin launched its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine - the term it uses for Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour. Within weeks of the assault, President Putin was calling on the Russian public to separate ""true patriots from scum and traitors"". Since then, across Russia there have been reports of Soviet-style denunciations against critics of the war. They include students informing on teachers and workers denouncing colleagues.  Public criticism of the invasion - and that includes reposting other people's criticism - is dangerous. The Russian authorities expect total, unflinching support for the offensive in Ukraine. If you don't support it, at the very least you're expected to stay silent. If you don't stay silent, there's a string of repressive laws for punishing dissent. That includes laws against spreading ""false information"" about the military and ""discrediting"" the army. In Arkhangelsk, a giant portrait of a Russian soldier killed in Ukraine stares down on the city from the side of a nine-storey apartment block, along with the words: ""Being a warrior means living forever.""  The patriotic messaging is persuasive. On the streets of Arkhangelsk, we find little sympathy for Russians facing prosecution for their anti-war comments.  ""People who discredit our army or spread fakes, they're sick in the head,"" Konstantin tells me. ""They should be sent to the front line as cannon fodder.""  ""I have a negative attitude to critics of the special operation,"" Ekaterina tells me.  But a long prison sentence for posting something online, isn't that harsh? I ask. ""People should use their brains,"" Ekaterina replies. ""If they live in this country, if they enjoy all the benefits this country has to offer, if they're patriots, they need to abide by the law."" Later that day Olesya is allowed out of her flat. But only to attend a court hearing. Her defence lawyers are trying to persuade a judge to lift the restrictions on her movement.  Olesya's T-shirt sports a picture of a police van with ""School Bus"" written on it. A comment on how young Russians are being punished for their criticism of the authorities. The judge rules to keep her under house arrest. ""The state doesn't have the stomach for debate, for democracy or freedom,"" Olesya says. ""But they can't put everyone in prison. At some point they'll run out of cells."" Produced by Liza Shuvalova. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

Elsewhere in Hatay, a 12-year-old girl, Cudie, was saved after being trapped for 147 hours. State media also reported a 13-year-old saved in Gaziantep on Sunday, with rescuers saying: ""You are a miracle."" The number of people confirmed to have died in Turkey and Syria has risen to more than 33,000.  Syria has not reported an updated death toll since Friday, so the true number is likely higher. Hopes are dwindling of finding many more survivors, and on the ground there is a sense that the rescue mission will soon end.  The Syrian Civil Defence Force, or White Helmets, which operates in in rebel-held areas of the country, has told the BBC that the group's search efforts are winding down. But tens of thousands of rescuers continued their search overnight across affected areas in Turkey and Syria. The seven-month-old baby, Hamza, was saved on Saturday, and footage from local authorities showed rescuers cheering and hugging one another. Separate video from the Turkish health ministry showed a small girl in a neck brace looking around as she was carried on a stretcher in the same province later on Sunday morning.  And footage showed a father and daughter being pulled from a building in Hatay. ""He wants two cups of good tea,"" one of the rescuers said. But as the rescue operations wind down, the focus turns to recovery - and of reckoning with the situation.  Thousands of buildings collapsed during the earthquake, raising questions about whether the natural disaster's impact was made worse by human failings. Turkey's President Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but, during one visit to a disaster zone earlier in the week, appeared to blame fate.  ""Such things have always happened,"" he said. ""It's part of destiny's plan."" Officials say they have issued 113 arrest warrants in connection with the construction of buildings that collapsed, with 12 people taken into custody, including contractors.  Rescuers in Syria have criticised the international response to the disaster, with the UN's relief chief Martin Griffiths saying the world has ""failed the people in north-west Syria"".  ""They rightly feel abandoned. Looking for international help that hasn't arrived,"" he said. Ismail al Abdullah, of the White Helmets, told the BBC's Quentin Sommerville that the international community has ""blood on its hands"".

Moments later they were under mounds of rubble.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64620357,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16699/production/_128610819_babybest.jpg,2023-02-13T02:12:25Z,"It has been a week since a deadly earthquake struck Turkey and Syria, killing thousands. But amid the despair, there have been stories of ""miracles"". This is one of them. When Necla Camuz gave birth to her second son on 27 January, she named him Yagiz, meaning ""brave one"". Just 10 days later, at 04:17 local time, Necla was awake feeding her son at their home in southern Turkey's Hatay province. Moments later, they were buried under mounds of rubble. Necla and her family lived on the second floor of a modern five-storey building in the town of Samandag. It was a ""nice building"", she says, and she had felt safe there. She did not know that morning that the area would be torn apart by the earthquake, with buildings damaged and destroyed at every turn. ""When the earthquake started, I wanted to go to my husband who was in the other room, and he wanted to do the same thing,"" she says.  ""But as he tried to come to me with our other son, the wardrobe fell onto them and it was impossible for them to move. ""As the earthquake got bigger, the wall fell, the room was shaking, and the building was changing position. When it stopped, I didn't realise that I had fallen one floor down. I shouted their names but there was no answer."" The 33-year-old found herself lying down with her baby on her chest, still held in her arms. A fallen wardrobe next to her saved their lives by preventing a large slab of concrete from crushing them. The pair would remain in this position for almost four days. Lying in her pyjamas beneath the rubble, Necla could see nothing but ""pitch black"". She had to rely on her other senses to work out what was going on. To her relief, she could tell immediately that Yagiz was still breathing. Because of the dust, she struggled at first to breathe, but said it soon settled. She was warm in the rubble. She felt as though there were children's toys beneath her but could not manoeuvre herself to check, or to make herself more comfortable. Other than the wardrobe, the soft skin of her newborn son, and the clothes they wore, she could feel nothing but concrete and debris. In the distance, she could hear voices. She tried to shout for help and bang on the wardrobe. ""Is there anyone there? Can anyone hear me?"" she called. When that didn't work, she picked up the small bits of rubble that had fallen next to her. She banged them against the wardrobe, hoping it would be louder. She was scared to hit the surface above her in case it collapsed. Still, no one replied. Necla realised there was a possibility nobody would come. ""I was terrified,"" she says. In the darkness beneath the rubble, Necla lost all sense of time. This wasn't what life was supposed to be like.  ""You plan lots of things when you have a new baby, and thenâ¦ all of a sudden you're under rubble,"" she says. Still, she knew she had to look after Yagiz, and was able to breastfeed him in the confined space. There was no source of water or food that she could access for herself. In desperation, she tried unsuccessfully to drink her own breast milk. Necla could feel the rumble of drills overhead and hear footsteps and voices, but the muffled sounds felt far away. She decided to save her energy and remain quiet unless the noises from outside came closer. She thought constantly of her family - the baby on her chest, and the husband and son lost somewhere in the debris. She also worried about how other loved ones had fared in the earthquake. Necla did not think she would make it out of the rubble, but Yagiz's presence gave her a reason to remain hopeful. He slept much of the time, and when he woke crying, she would silently feed him until he settled down. After more than 90 hours underground, Necla heard the sound of dogs barking. She wondered if she was dreaming. The barks were followed by the sound of voices. ""Are you OK? Knock once for yes,"" one called into the rubble. ""What apartment do you live in?"" She had been found. Rescuers carefully dug into the ground to locate her, as she held Yagiz. The darkness was broken by a torch light shining into her eyes. When the rescue team from the Istanbul Municipality Fire Department asked how old Yagiz was, Necla couldn't be sure. She only knew that he was 10 days old when the earthquake struck. After handing Yagiz to the rescuers, Necla was then carried away on a stretcher in front of what seemed to be a large crowd. She couldn't recognise any faces. As she was moved to an ambulance, she sought confirmation that her other son had also been saved. When she got to hospital, Necla was greeted by family members who told her that her husband of six years, Irfan, and her three-year-old son, Yigit Kerim, had been rescued from the rubble. But they had been transferred hours away to a hospital in Adana province, having sustained serious injuries to their legs and feet. Remarkably, Necla and Yagiz had suffered no serious physical injuries. They were kept in hospital for 24 hours for observation before being discharged. Necla had no home to return to, but a family member brought her back to a makeshift blue tent crafted from wood and tarpaulin. There are 13 of them there in total - all have lost their homes. In the tent, the family support each other, making pots of coffee over a small stove, playing chess and sharing stories. Necla is ""trying"" to come to terms with what happened to her. She says she owes Yagiz for saving her life. ""I think if my baby hadn't been strong enough to handle this, I wouldn't have been either,"" she explains. Her only dream for her son is that he never experiences anything like this again. ""I'm very happy he's a newborn baby and won't remember anything,"" she says. As a call comes in Necla grins. From a hospital bed Irfan and Yigit Kerim smile and wave. ""Hi warrior, how are you my son?"" Irfan asks his baby through the screen.  Additional reporting by Emrah Bulut. Â© 2023 BBC.

No cause of death has been given for the rapper, who went by the stage name Trugoy the Dove. The American musician had previously spoken publicly about his congestive heart failure in recent years. Jolicoeur co-founded the legendary trio - alongside Posdnuos (Kelvin Mercer) and Maseo (Vincent Lamont Mason Jr). The group changed the face of hip-hop in the late 80s and early 90s, and was honoured at last week's Grammy Awards in Los Angeles during a tribute to the genre. Writing on Twitter, B Real - a rapper with the hip-hop group Cypress Hill - described Jolicoeur as a ""legend of hip hop music and culture"". ""His music will allow him to live in our hearts and minds,"" he wrote. ""But not only was he a great musician but he was a great human being. He meant a lot to us."" Last month, the group's classic albums were made available for streaming online. Complex licensing issues around De La Soul's use of hundreds of samples had held back the move until now. De La Soul's first six records will be released on digital streaming services for the first time on 3 March. 3 Feet High and Rising, which was their debut album in 1989, reached number one on Billboard's top R&B/hip-hop album chart and often appears on lists of the greatest albums of all time.

Mr Murdaugh, scion of a legal dynasty, has pleaded not guilty in the fatal shootings of his wife and son.  The trial in Walterboro, South Carolina - which has ended its third week - is just one piece of his stunning downfall, which features accusations of corruption and a faked assassination.  The case has captivated the state.  ""It's the only thing happening in Walterboro - the only thing that's ever happened in Walterboro,"" said Cassie Headden, as she waited in line on Friday morning.  Spectators say they were fascinated by both the alleged crimes and the dramatic downfall of a storied southern family. From 1920 to 2006, three generations of Murdaughs served consecutively as chief prosecutors for the area, while their private family litigation firm earned them a small fortune.   ""They ruled this area for years and years, and now that's starting to crumble - at least it looks like it,"" said Wally Pregnall, who travelled from Charleston to watch the trial.  Others have come in from across the country - California, Idaho, Wisconsin and Maine - turning this small city in the southern part of the state into a true-crime tourist destination.  One group of friends carpooled an hour's drive from Hilton Head Island to watch together; another family drove two hours from Aiken, South Carolina, and took the day off work. Earlier this week, a local middle school teacher brought her class of teenagers in as a field trip.   ""I feel like it's being a part of history and we just wanted to be here to witness it,"" said Monica Petersen outside the court on Friday.  The regulars carried snacks and water in clear plastic purses - the only type of bag allowed in court - and packed coats and scarves to stay warm inside the heavily air conditioned courtroom. Some brought notebooks, scribbling along to the proceedings, after willingly giving up their mobile phones, which are banned for spectators.  ""We've joked that if John Grisham wrote this novel that people would have said he's lost it, because it's too unbelievable,"" said Walt Flowers, also from Charleston.  Over three weeks, Creighton Waters, the lead prosecutor, has called dozens of witnesses and pulled from a mountain of evidence in an attempt to prove that Mr Murdaugh fatally shot his wife Maggie, 52, and son Paul, 22, at the dog kennels on the family's 1,700 acre hunting estate, Moselle. Mr Murdaugh, prosecutors allege, was stealing from his family firm - millions of dollars over a decade. The murders, they argued, were a desperate attempt to earn sympathy and prevent his financial crimes from coming to light.  His lawyer, state Senator Dick Harpootlian, has rejected this theory in court, arguing his client - a loving family man - could not have murdered his family.  ""He didn't kill - butcher - his son and wife,"" Mr Harpootlian said in court. ""And you need to put from your mind any suggestion that he did."" Next week, prosecutors are expected to call Curtis Eddie Smith - known as Cousin Eddie - who is alleged to have tried to shoot Mr Murdaugh on a rural road just three months after his wife and son were killed. Mr Murdaugh has admitted he organised the botched hit on himself so that his surviving son could collect $10m (Â£8.4m) in life insurance payments.Â  But Mr Smith said he never agreed to the hit, and the gun went off by mistake: ""If I shot him, he'd be dead."" Mr Murdaugh also faces separate charges for insurance fraud, theft, lying to the police and other crimes. He has yet to enter a plea in those cases. In court, friends and former colleagues testified that Mr Murdaugh confessed and apologised for stealing. His lawyer has told media the stolen money was used to feed an opioid addiction. The proceedings have been tedious at times, with hours of repetitive testimony regarding minute details of Mr Murdaugh's alleged financial misdeeds.  But other witnesses have provided an intimate look at the Murdaugh family's private life, revealing details of the final moments of Maggie and Paul's life.  Testifying on Friday, Blanca Turrubiate-Simpson, who worked as a housekeeper for the Murdaughs, testified that Maggie had texted her the evening she died from the family's beach home on Edisto Island. Maggie wanted to stay the night at Edisto, Ms Turrbiate-Simpson said, but Mr Murdaugh had asked her to come back to Moselle.  ""She sounded like she didn't want to come home,"" Ms Turrubiate-Simpson said of Maggie. ""She liked being at Edisto.""  And mobile phone evidence from that same night - a Snapchat video filmed by Paul and sent to a friend - placed Mr Murdaugh with his family minutes before prosecutors say they were killed. Mr Murdaugh had previously said he had not been at the dog kennels that night at all.  The prosecution is expected to rest next week, giving the defence a chance to mount its case.  Mr Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted.  Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking. "

The Afrin Health Directorate took the precautionary measure to protect the girl, Aya, from possible kidnapping and adoption fraud, a source told the BBC. On Monday, there was a violent incident at the hospital in the opposition-held region where she was being treated. A male nurse, accompanied by two armed men, allegedly beat the manager.  The head of the health directorate, Dr Ahmad Hajj Hassan, denied claims on social media that it was a foiled attempt to kidnap Aya. ""The kidnap allegations were a misunderstanding. This was a wholly internal hospital-related issue and had no connection whatsoever with the baby,"" he told the BBC. Thousands of people offered to adopt the baby last week, after her story was widely reported by local and international media. However, the health directorate is determined to prioritise her welfare and act cautiously with the adoption process, according to the source.  Aya's mother went into labour soon after their family home in the town of Jindayris was destroyed by the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck southern Turkey on 6 February. She died after giving birth to Aya, who was still connected by her umbilical cord when she was found by rescuers. Dramatic footage shared on social media showed a man carrying the baby, covered in dust, after she was pulled from debris. Aya's father, four siblings and an aunt were also killed in the disaster.  Khalil al-Suwadi, a distant relative who was there when she was pulled to safety, brought the baby to the hospital in Afrin. The paediatrician looking after her, Dr Hani Marouf, told the BBC last Thursday that Aya had arrived in ""a bad state"". ""She had bumps, bruises, she was cold and barely breathing,"" he added. She responded to treatment and by the next day her condition had stabilised. The hospital's manager, Khalid Attiah, said his wife was breastfeeding Aya alongside their own four-month daughter and that they would care for her until she was adopted. Jindaryis, about 8km (5 miles) from the Turkish border, was one of the worst-hit towns in Syria. Some 200 buildings there have completely collapsed. The White Helmets, whose volunteer first responders have been leading the search and rescue effort in opposition-held areas, say 517 bodies have been pulled from the rubble there.  The deaths represent almost a quarter of the total reported by the White Helmets and opposition authorities across the region, where 90% of the 4.6 million population needed humanitarian assistance even before the disaster.

The setting sun lights up Horsetail Falls for a few weeks every February in a phenomenon called a ""firefall"". When conditions are just right, the waterfall looks like lava gushing thousands of feet from a high cliff. The spectacle lasts only a few minutes a day, but attracts hundreds of visitors to the park every year. Haze or even slight cloudiness can diminish or eliminate the effect, the National Park Service says. But ""when the sun drops at the exact right angle,"" spokesman Scott Gediman tells AFP, ""it's magical"". California and much of the western US has been plagued by drought for years, threatening the firefall's appearance. But the downpours and massive flooding that devastated much of the west early this year have plumped up the state's watercourses, making this year's firefall picture-perfect. Wednesday's freezing temperatures did not deter park visitors, who either sat, knelt or stood atop sheets of ice with cameras in their hands.  ""The pictures I've seen are just gorgeous,"" amateur photographer Terry Cantrell told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. ""Everybody wants to have their own, so this is what I'm trying to do."" But not everybody gets see the firefall, even when conditions are just right. The National Park Service limits visitors through a reservation system in order to protect the natural surroundings.

Her uncle tearfully told rescuers ""we will never forget you"", as he hugged them one by one. Aleyna survived, injured and in freezing weather conditions, for 10 days. But rescues like hers are becoming increasingly rare. More than 41,000 people have died in Tukey and neighbouring Syria from the 7.8 magnitude earthquake. Neither country has revealed how many people are still missing. Aleyna was gently prised from the ruins of a flattened apartment block, Turkish broadcaster TRT Haber reported. ""She looked to be in good health. She opened and closed her eyes,"" Ali Akdogan, a coal miner who took part in the rescue, told AFP news agency. ""We have been working here in this building for a week now... we are happy whenever we find a living thing - even a cat,"" he added. But the celebrations did not last long. Shortly after the rescue, Turkish soldiers ordered people to leave the scene, because teams were finding corpses that would soon be carried out. In the same city, three women and two children were found alive on Wednesday. Meanwhile the United Nations (UN) launched a ""flash appeal"" on Thursday for $1bn in aid to help the victims in Turkey. The funding will help 5.2 million people over the next three months and allow aid organisations to ""rapidly scale up"" their support, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said in a statement. And in Syria, the UN said that more than 100 trucks loaded with aid have crossed into the north-west of the country, since the Syrian government agreed to allow the UN to use two more border crossings.

The BBC said: ""We will continue to co-operate with the authorities and hope matters are resolved as soon as possible."" It said it ""will continue to report without fear or favour"". The investigation comes weeks after the BBC aired a documentary in the UK critical of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The BBC statement continued: ""We are supporting staff - some of whom have faced lengthy questioning or been required to stay overnight - and their welfare is our priority.  ""Our output is back to normal and we remain committed to serving our audiences in India and beyond. ""The BBC is a trusted, independent media organisation and we stand by our colleagues and journalists who will continue to report without fear or favour."" The BBC's documentary, India: The Modi Question, was broadcast on television only in the UK, but India's government has attempted to block people sharing it, describing it as ""hostile propaganda and anti-India garbage"" with a ""colonial mindset"".  The documentary focused on the prime minister's role in anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002, when he was chief minister of the state. The BBC said last month the Indian government was offered a right to reply to the documentary, but it declined. The Editors Guild of India - a non-profit group which promotes press freedom - said earlier this week it was ""deeply concerned"" about the searches.  It said they were a ""continuation of a trend of using government agencies to intimidate and harass press organisations that are critical of government policies or the ruling establishment"", it said. Amnesty International India's Board accused authorities of ""trying to harass and intimidate the BBC over its critical coverage of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party"". But the party said the searches were lawful and the government had nothing to do with their timing.

Taiwan's military said it had spotted an unidentified object drifting above Dongyin - a Taiwanese-controlled island off China's coast - at 11:00 local time (03:00 GMT) on Thursday. It later found a crash site on a shooting range. Initial investigations suggested the remnants were part of a meteorological instrument, the military added. On Friday, Taiwan's Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said that officials would further investigate the crashed balloon but would not ""jump to conclusions"". This is the first time remnants of such a balloon have been discovered in Taiwan's offshore islands, said senior defence official Chen Yu-lin, according to local media. Tensions between China and the US have seen a fresh spike in recent weeks, after the US downed what it said was a Chinese surveillance balloon in its airspace earlier this month. The US also shot down three other objects it says are unlikely to be foreign spy crafts. The sphere found on Dongyin was about a metre in diameter and bore the name of a China-based company that, based on online searches, stocks meteorological and radio appliances. The company Taiyuan Radio No 1 Factory Co. Ltd is based in Taiyuan, one of China's main industrial bases and capital of Shanxi province. The sphere was also marked ""GTS13 digital atmospheric sounding instrument"" and ""meteorological instrument"", with simplified Chinese language characters, the military said in a statement. China has used simplified Chinese characters since the 1950s, but Taiwan continues to use traditional characters. Authorities have not released pictures of the object. Taiwan's defence ministry said on Tuesday that it had not detected any Chinese surveillance balloons, but it had spotted weather balloons previously. It also said it would not hesitate to shoot down any balloon it deemed a threat. These comments came after the Financial Times reported earlier this week - citing unnamed officials - that dozens of Chinese military balloons had been spotted in Taiwan's airspace in recent years. China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control.  But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders. Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Two female students are reported missing in the Ishkoshim area. Footage has emerged from one area, showing rescue teams pulling a child from a collapsed house. Crowds nearby are seen digging through the deep snow in the hope of finding more survivors.  Many local residents have been evacuated to safer areas.

Experts say such workers are vulnerable to exploitation because of a lack of will and legal safeguards to protect them. The girl, who was brought to hospital with multiple injuries, told police that she had been tortured by her employers over five months. ""She was in an extremely pathetic condition,"" said journalist and documentary filmmaker Deepika Narayan Bharadwaj, who tipped off the child rescue services after hearing about the girl from a friend.  ""A friend called and told me that while visiting his relatives in Gurgaon [a Delhi suburb], he'd seen this girl when she was taking out trash. He said her face was bloodied and covered in bruises,"" Ms Bharadwaj told me. When Ms Bharadwaj met the teenager in hospital, she heard first-hand her account of the horrific treatment she is said to have endured.  ""She told me that she was beaten every day, in fact several times a day, for not completing work on time,"" she said.  Police have arrested the girl's employers, Manish Khattar and his wife Kamaljeet Kaur, and charged them under various sections of the law. Police claim the girl's injuries are consistent with torture. A police official told The Indian Express that ""the couple allegedly used to beat her mercilessly for not working properly. She has several cut and burn injuries, suspected to have been inflicted with a blade or hot tongs"". ""The girl had injuries on several parts of her body - face, arms, hands and feet. On one of her arms, her skin had been burnt,"" he said, adding that ""a medical examination has been conducted and legal action will be taken."" The photos the BBC has seen of the injuries sustained by the girl show cuts and burns to her face and body. They are too distressing to include in this article.  In her statement to the police, the girl has also alleged that her employers forced her to ""take off her clothes while doing laundry and other chores and she was made to sleep on the floorâ¦ without clothes"".   This appears to have prompted them to charge the couple with sexual harassment under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. The couple are in police custody and have not commented on the allegations yet. The BBC has attempted to get in touch with the couple's legal representatives but has been unable to get a response.   Police said Mr Khattar worked as a deputy manager with a prominent life insurance company and his wife was working with a public relations firm. Since the allegations surfaced, the couple have been sacked by their companies. ""They were treating her like a slave,"" comments Nishi Kant, executive director of anti-trafficking NGO Shakti Vahini that is working with the girl now. ""She was not given enough food and was compelled to eat from the dustbin. ""We are also trying to find out who is the uncle who brought her to Gurgaon, which is the placement agency which got her the job and what happened to her remuneration because she never got paid,"" he said. The brutality the girl was made to suffer has shocked India and made headlines but campaigners point out that claims of abuse and exploitation of domestic helpers are not infrequent in a country where millions of women and children, both boys and girls, from poor families work as servants in affluent and middle class homes. In 2013, police in Delhi arrested a 50-year-old woman for assaulting and torturing her 15-year-old maid. The girl had a severe head injury and bite marks on her body.  The previous year, a doctor couple from the city were arrested for locking up their 13-year-old domestic servant and going on holiday to Thailand. Neighbours alerted police and activists after they heard the girl crying and screaming for help from the balcony.  One thing that was common in all three cases is that the victims were from Jharkhand, one of the poorest states in India. ""Because of extreme poverty, girls drop out of school on hitting puberty. They're then lured with promises of jobs to Delhi and other cities by dodgy employment agencies that are not registered,"" says Rishi Kant, spokesman for Shakti Vahini.    ""In the city, they are placed in homes of people where they are often in exploitative situations. Many are assaulted, they have few freedoms."" According to official statistics, India has 4.75 million domestic workers, including three million women. But the International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates the true numbers to be between 20 and 80 million.  That's because in India, housework involves a lot of heavy lifting. Since few homes are equipped with dishwashers, vacuum cleaners or washing machines, nearly all middle class and affluent families hire workers for sweeping, cleaning dishes, laundry, cooking and childcare. The law says children above 14 can also be employed as housework is not considered hazardous.  The arrangement is an important livelihood source for those with little or no education - but Meenakshi Gupta Jain, who runs Helper4U, an online portal that connects workers with employers, says it also opens them to all sorts of exploitation. ""What makes domestic helpers so vulnerable to exploitation is that they have no legal contract, there are no minimum guaranteed wages, the prevention of sexual harassment act which protects women in workspaces does not apply to them, and far away from their homes, many have no support system.  ""Even if they are hit, they have no one to turn to for help,"" she says, adding that ""such instances will keep happening until and unless we bring in strict legislation with strict penalties, act against agencies and employers"".  Ms Jain says that children are especially vulnerable and although ""the government says that children can work at home because home is not hazardous, behind closed doors a home can be the most hazardous workplace in the world"". But the plight of domestic workers is rarely talked about in India, unless a particularly brutal case makes headlines.  Ms Jain says there must be public messaging to tell Indians that it's important to treat domestic staff well. ""We are creating hype about all sorts of things, so why not create hype about how we should be treating the domestic help?"" Mr Kant says that an anti-trafficking bill that's been pending in parliament for years now must be passed if the issue is to be addressed. ""Those bringing vulnerable girls and placing them in exploitative situations need to be targeted and punished.""  Under the current laws, Mr Kant says it's not going to be easy to punish the couple accused of assaulting their maid. ""We have a tough battle ahead. Plenty of similar cases happen, but most end in nothing. Quite often, the family of the victim take the money and settle out of court."" In the 2013 case, he points out that the 50-year-old woman was bailed after a month. It took the court four years to convict her, and in the end she was let go with a fine of just 1,000 rupees ($12; Â£10). Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Washington has said these were probably civilian-owned balloons. ""Systematic searches"" over Alaska, Lake Huron and the Yukon found no debris. These searches were unsuccessful despite the US military, federal agencies and Canadian partners searching each area using airborne imagery, a variety of sensors, and below-surface scans, said Washington's Northern Command.

The Carter Center said Mr Carter had decided to ""spend his remaining time at home with his family,"" but did not say what had prompted the decision.  Mr Carter, 98, has suffered from recent health issues, including a melanoma that spread to his liver and brain. The country's oldest living leader, he served one term in office from 1977-81. During his tenure as president Mr Carter faced a spate of foreign policy challenges and the Democrat was defeated in his re-election bid by Ronald Reagan.  ""He has the full support of his family and his medical team. The Carter family asks for privacy during this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers,"" the Carter Center said in a statement on Saturday. Terminally ill patients may seek hospice care instead of going through further medical treatment. The priority is not to provide further treatment, but to provide comfort towards the end of a patient's life.  Mr Carter's grandson, Jason Carter, a former Georgia state senator, tweeted that he visited ""both of my grandparents yesterday."" ""They are at peace and - as always - their home is full of love. Thank you all for your kind words,"" he said.  In 2021, Mr Carter and his wife Roslyn celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary. They have four children together. Born in Georgia in 1924, Mr Carter entered politics in the 1960s when he was elected as state senator, before becoming the state's governor in 1971. Five years later he defeated the sitting Republican President Gerald Ford to become the 39th commander-in-chief.  But problems quickly mounted for Mr Carter as president.  At home, an oil crisis produced high inflation and unemployment, and he struggled to persuade Americans to accept the required austerity measures. The high-point of the Carter years was the signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978 in which Egypt formally recognised the state of Israel. He also signed a treaty returning control of the Panama Canal to Panama. But in 1979 the last Shah of Iran was overthrown and 66 Americans were taken hostage in Tehran in the aftermath. Mr Carter cut off diplomatic relations with Iran in response and introduced a trade embargo. However, the public did not believe he was being tough enough and his popularity slumped as the US hostages were held for 444 days. His approval ratings took a further hit after an attempt to rescue the hostages failed and eight US military members were killed. Iran then delayed the release of the hostages until after Ronald Reagan was sworn in. Since leaving the White House, Mr Carter has remained active, carrying out humanitarian work with his Carter Center. He led a delegation that sought to persuade military leaders in Haiti to surrender power in 1994 and he brokered a ceasefire in Bosnia that helped pave the way for the future peace treaty there. He went on to gain an international reputation for his work in promoting human rights, winning a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. With Nelson Mandela, he founded The Elders, a group of global leaders who committed themselves to work on peace and human rights.  He also travelled extensively - well into his early 90s - and took part in annual trips to build homes with the Habitat for Humanity charity.  But the former president has also battled a host of health issues in recent years. In August 2015, Mr Carter had a small cancerous mass removed from his liver.  The following year he announced that he needed no further treatment, as an experimental drug had eliminated any sign of cancer.  He has frequently expressed a striking calmness when dealing with his health challenges.  ""I'm perfectly at ease with whatever comes,"" he said in 2015. ""I've had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence."" Mr Carter celebrated his most recent birthday in October in Plains, the tiny Georgia town where he and his wife were born between the First World War and the Great Depression, and where they returned when he left office.  A host of senior US politicians - including Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock - offered their thoughts and prayers to Mr Carter's family as news broke on Saturday night.  ""In this tender time of transitioning, God is surely walking with him,"" Senator Warnock tweeted. ""May he, Rosalynn & the entire Carter family be comforted with that peace and surrounded by our love & prayers."" Â© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Depending on who you ask, the planned multi-million dollar building - known as the National Cathedral of Ghana - is either a symbol of the country's economic mismanagement or a strategic and bold investment. In a speech at the turn of the new year, just two weeks after Ghana effectively defaulted on repaying most of its external debt amid a mounting cost-of-living and economic crisis, President Nana Akufo-Addo, scoffing at critics, renewed his commitment to the religious building. ""The National Cathedral is an act of thanksgiving to the Almighty for his blessings, favour, grace and mercies on our nation,"" the president said at the construction site where a Bible-reading marathon had been taking place.  God, he said, had spared Ghana from conflict that had afflicted many countries, including some of its West African neighbours, who have been dealing with numerous security challenges. The president then announced a personal donation of 100,000 cedis ($8,000; Â£6,700) towards the construction costs. It was envisioned to be a sacred space for all Christians, who make up 70% of the population, and where national religious services could take place. But Mr Akufo-Addo's enthusiasm for the project has divided public opinion.  Though most of the costs are supposed to be covered by donations, with the state providing the land and some seed funding, critics have queried the amount of money - some $58m - that the government has so far spent in these economically straitened times. On top of this, the project has been beset by allegations of misappropriation of funds as well as questions over the awarding of the design tender to celebrated British-Ghanaian architect Sir David Adjaye, a situation that caused friction with some of the top Christian leaders who make up the National Cathedral board of trustees. The authorities reject these claims and the board has approved a financial audit, as well as agreeing to let parliament investigate the way contracts were awarded. Ghanaian economist Theo Acheampong believes the government's priorities are misplaced, considering the country's current economic situation, including a depreciating currency, dwindling foreign reserves and strained public finances. ""This is a generational crisis. Inflation is in excess of 50%, the country is not able to repay its debt, forcing the government to cut back on expenditure. And also at a time the government is seeking a $3bn loan from the International Monetary Fund, the cathedral is not a priority for the nation,"" Mr Acheampong said. Mr Akufo-Addo first revealed plans for the cathedral after he won the 2016 election and the architect was appointed two years later. But work on what the president has referred to as ""his gratitude to God"" only began in 2022, two years after his re-election. However, the sound of heavy machinery carving the earth and animated workers shouting over the din at the construction site is no more after MPs refused in December to approve a further budget allocation of $6.3m from the government. Contributing to a debate in parliament last month MP Sam George, a prominent critic of the project, quoted the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament to excoriate the government.  ""Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, saying: 'This person began to build and wasn't able to finish,"" his opposition colleagues suitably amused, cheered when he finished reading the verses.  The project cannot be faulted for its vision. A nine-acre site of prime land between the parliament building, the national theatre and the international conference centre, was hived off for the National Cathedral. It had earlier been occupied by residential houses for judges, a decision to demolish them sparked its own controversy. Drawing inspiration from Ghana's rich arts and culture, the cathedral will have a high pitched staggered roof imitating the architecture of the Akan people. It will also include emblems like the royal stool from the Ashanti people and ceremonial canopies. Artists from Ghana and other African countries will be invited to create the cathedral's religious adornment and furnishings. According to the plan, the main building will have 5,000 permanent seats with room for thousands more, a music school, an art gallery, shops, a national crypt for state burials and it will also be home to Africa's first Bible museum.  However, the grandeur does not impress its critics. ""Tax-payers' money should not be used fund a personal pledge to God,"" the MP Mr George told the BBC.  He referred to the cathedral as a ""vanity project"" reminiscent of the The Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro  - the largest church in the world - built by Ivory Coast's independence leader FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny to transform his hometown. ""We are Christians but the government has no business funding the construction of a religious building,"" Mr George said.  Despite the opposition, Paul Opoku-Mensah, the presidential appointee leading the National Cathedral project, remains confident in its viability and sees it as a way to boost the economy. ""Unlike Ivory Coast, we have a strategy of bringing visitors to Ghana. We have to use our religiosity for our own development,"" he said. Mr Mensah has visited the Bible Museum in Washington DC and is negotiating loaning religious artefacts from Israel to display at the cathedral once complete. The cost of the project has been a moving target, according to critics, who say it has been inflated over time, including a claim that it could rise to $1bn. But Mr Mensah told the BBC that the building would cost no more than $350m. ""That figure is sacrosanct,"" he said explaining that the cathedral would be a Christian hub attracting visitors on the continent and beyond making it economically viable.  He also denied claims that the cathedral was the Christian majority's response to the $10m Ghana National Mosque which was built using funding from the Turkish government. That was launched in 2012. But Mr Mensah said the project had been ""caught up in the divisive politics of our country"", adding that while Ghana's economic crisis cannot be ignored, critics did not appreciate the viability of the cathedral, which early estimates say could generate $95m in five years.  ""We're looking at what great cathedrals did to Europe by extending the frontiers in music, art and engineering, but given the economic conditions we face, we can review our plan, like do phased construction and reconsider what type of artefacts we install in the building,"" he said.  After parliament rejected funding for the cathedral, Mr Mensah said his team was looking at other ways of raising the money.  ""We are developing plans for mass mobilisation of funds; like rallying a million Christians to donate $20 a month for two years. We also want to attract donors, the private sector and the diaspora community to contribute.""  Mr Mensah has however not given up on convincing MPs to back funding for the project. He hopes to organise a meeting with them because he believes some do not have a full understanding of the project.  But he too admits the project is under threat and unlikely to be completed next year before President Akufo-Addo leaves office. ""The completion is dependent on our ability to raise the needed resources. That's what we are focused on now,"" Mr Mensah said. Â© 2023 BBC.

      President Joe Biden spoke at a union hall in northern Virginia Thursday afternoon, attempting to cast himself as a defender of the middle class by leaning into his economic accomplishments and contrasting them with the Republican proposals he says would be catastrophic for Americans’ pocketbooks.
   
      “We’re moving in the right direction. Now we’ve got to protect those gains … that our policies have generated, protect them from the MAGA Republicans in the House of Representatives who are threatening to destroy this progress,” Biden said. 
   
      As Washington has been gearing up for a standoff over the debt ceiling and the potential for a global economic fallout later this year, the speech gave Biden a chance to turn the focus away from news of the discovery of classified documents in unsecured areas in his home and office. The unfolding story has been a magnet of Republican scrutiny and press attention. But in his speech to union workers in Springfield – a Virginia suburb just outside Washington, D.C. –  Biden offered a preview of his potential reelection messaging strategy, turning focus back to what the White House really wants to be talking about. 
   
      In his remarks, Biden contrasted his administration’s work with Republicans’ plans to cut entitlement programs and impose a 30% national sales tax. He also discussed progress on wage growth and unemployment, as well as key legislation, such as the CHIPS Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law. 
   
      “Here’s the deal: they want to cut your Social Security and Medicare … beyond that they’re actually threatening to have us default on the American debt,” the president said. 
   
      “I have a rhetorical question: (Why) in God’s name would Americans give up the progress we’ve made for the chaos they’re suggesting? I don’t get it. That’s why the MAGA Republicans are literally choosing to inflict this pain on the American people. Why?” Biden asked. “I will not let it happen. Not on my watch. I will veto everything they send.” 
   
      The president said he’s willing to work with Republicans “on real solutions and continue to grow manufacturing jobs and build the strongest economy in the world and make sure Americans are paid a fair wage.” But he added that he “will not let anyone use the full faith and credit of the United States as a bargaining chip.” 
   
      Biden also announced an “Invest in America” Cabinet, which will be charged “with ensuring that his economic plan is generating private sector investment and continues to drive our economic progress for years ahead,” according to an administration official. 
   
      The group will include Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, EPA Administrator Michael Regan, Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu and senior adviser John Podesta.
   
      Biden also celebrated newly released data showing the US economy grew more than expected in the final quarter of last year, registering solid growth to end 2022 even as consumers and businesses battled inflation and historically high interest rates.
   
      Gross domestic product – the broadest measure of economic activity – increased at an annualized rate of 2.9% from October to December last year, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday. For 2022, GDP expanded 2.1%, the report showed.
   
      GOP legislative proposals to cut Social Security and Medicare have yet to formally materialize, but House Republicans have reportedly been considering leveraging cuts to the programs in the debt ceiling fight, according to the Washington Post. 
   
      Although a plan hasn’t been formalized, the White House has already blasted congressional Republicans this week for suggesting the cuts to offset the deficit as part of negotiations over raising the nation’s debt limit.
   
      White House spokesperson Andrew Bates argued in a statement earlier this week that “under the guise of ‘fiscal responsibility,’ (Republicans) want to cut the benefits that middle class Americans pay for throughout their working lives, but they also want to enlarge the deficit with new tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans. This is nothing more than an extreme plot to sell out middle class families to rich special interests at any cost.”
   
      Within the first week of the new Congress, a dozen House Republicans introduced a bill that would abolish the IRS altogether and replace the entire federal tax code with a national sales tax.
   
      While that legislation is unlikely to become law given that the Democrats maintain a majority in the Senate, Biden and Democrats see an opening to criticize the GOP for fringe proposals they say would harm the American economy.
   
      The national sales tax could leave low- and middle-income people worse off and would likely lower tax revenue. One estimate found that a tax rate of about 30% would more likely be able to generate the same amount of revenue – or 44%, if measured the way state sales taxes are typically presented.
   
      The White House and Biden have, of course, sharply criticized the proposal.
   
      The president on Thursday suggested the proposal was an effort to give the wealthy another tax break.
   
      “Who do you think is going to get ripped off?” Biden asked. “They want to raise taxes on working and middle class people in America by passing a national sales tax, taxing every items from groceries, gasoline, clothing, supplies, medicine.” 
   
      The president also acknowledged reports that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy may not be in favor of the tax. 
   
      In a statement following the president’s meeting this week with Democratic congressional leadership, the White House highlighted that they discussed the “continued stepped-up implementation of groundbreaking laws like the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.” The statement also emphasized “the importance of building on the historic economic progress,” such as low unemployment, expanding health care coverage and making gains to stabilize inflation. 
   
      In the statement, the White House said the group “agreed on continuing to work across the aisle … while also being honest about disagreements – like our opposition to an unprecedented middle class tax hike, inflation-worsening tax cuts for the rich, abortion bans, or cutting Social Security and Medicare.”
   
The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics’ quarterly Employment Cost Index showed that although employers continued hiking wages to attract workers and retain existing staff during the third quarter, their raises did not keep up with inflation.
   
      Wages and salaries for civilian workers increased by 1.3% in the third quarter and 5.1% over the year ending in September, according to the data, which was released last October. 
   
      The next release of the Employment Cost Index is scheduled to be released on Tuesday.

      Traveling across the country in recent years, I discovered a sure way to fire up an audience: issue a call to young people for a year of service to others.  
   
      “It’s called national service,” I tell people. “Sometime between the ages of 18 to 24 or so, we offer you an option to spend a year helping others — assisting teachers in classrooms, volunteering in a local hospital, reducing global warming and the like. For every year of service, you will receive not only a base salary, but you will also earn a scholarship to reduce future education debt.”
   
      Audiences clap loudly.  They know from experience that spending a year or more in a military uniform often stiffens a spine and focuses the mind.  It is obvious to most folks that a year of domestic service can have a similar impact.  
   
      Polling shows that Americans support national service. A 2017 Harvard Institute of Politics poll found that more than 60% of young Democrats and Republicans favored “a national service program for Americans under the age of 25 that would be linked to student loan forgiveness or other relevant incentives.” 
   
      Around the world, dozens of countries require some form of service — a list that includes Denmark, South Korea and Israel.     
   
      Yet, it has been nearly impossible to translate support for service into large-scale programs here in the United States. Presidents from George H.W. Bush to Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Barack Obama have spoken warmly of service years but have never come close to implementing what other nations have pulled together.  
   
      Every White House has had higher priorities. Partisanship gets in the way, idealism dims. Service years seem just out of reach.
   
      Until now!
   
      From the day of his massive election victory this past November, Wes Moore has emerged at the age of 44 to be one of the most promising young leaders in the country.  
   
      He is not only the first Black man to be elected governor of Maryland; he is the only third to be elected governor of any state in US history. More to the point, he is inspirational, recalling the early days of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama.
   
      During his recent campaign, Moore often talked about the importance of service to others but it’s hard during any campaign to evaluate how sincerely committed a candidate will be once in office.
   
      Well, Moore’s inaugural address last week settled it: he is hugely serious.  While many details are still to be ironed out, he sent waves of excitement through social change agents  as he has pledged three major advances.
   
      It is a myth, Moore argues, to believe that the only path to success and fulfillment is to study at an elite university.  As Martin Luther King Jr. observed in a 1968 sermon, “Everybody can be great… because everybody can serve.  You don’t have to have a college degree to serve. You don’t have to make your subject and verb agree to serve…  You only need a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love.” 
   
      It was in that same spirit of service that Wes Moore signed up for the US Army at 17 and went on to lead combat troops in Afghanistan in the famous 82nd Airborne.  “My years of service transformed me,” he said in his inaugural .  “My character was strengthened, my vistas were widened, my leadership was tested.”
   
      “A year of service will prepare young people for their careers — and provide our state with future leaders: public servants we desperately need.” 
   
      No doubt, there will be distractions and disappointments ahead for the new governor, who is a Democrat.  His incoming administration has a long and demanding agenda on several fronts.  Maryland currently incarcerates more young Black men than any other state, according to a recent report from the nonprofit Justice Policy Institute, and has a racial wealth gap of nearly 8-1. 
 
      But make no mistake, coming off his rousing inaugural and working with Republicans like Larry Hogan, his popular predecessor, Wes Moore has the potential to do something very special: turning Maryland into a national model for service and leadership.

      Microsoft on Monday confirmed it is making a “multibillion dollar” investment in OpenAI,  the company behind the viral new AI chatbot tool called ChatGPT.
   
      Microsoft, an early investor in OpenAI, said it plans to expand its existing partnership with the company as part of a greater effort to add more artificial intelligence to its suite of products. In a separate blog post, OpenAI said the multi-year investment will be used to “develop AI that is increasingly safe, useful, and powerful.”
   
      “We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, said in a statement. 
   
      The deepening partnership between the two companies has the potential to supercharge OpenAI’s ambitious projects, including ChatGPT,  which has captured the attention of – and sometimes sparked concerns from – academics, business leaders and tech enthusiasts with its ability to create  provide lengthy and thorough responses to user prompts and questions.
   
      The investment could also catapult Microsoft as an AI leader and ultimately pave the way for the company to incorporate ChatGPT into some of its hallmark applications, such as Word, PowerPoint and Outlook. 
   
      As a result of its existing exclusive deal with OpenAI, Microsoft recently said it would soon add ChatGPT features to to its cloud computing service, Azure. If ChatGPT becomes available on that service, businesses could use the tools directly within its apps and services, too.
   
      The investment comes days after Microsoft announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees as part of broader cost-cutting measures. Nadella said at the time that the company will continue to invest in “strategic areas for our future” and pointed to advances in AI as “the next major wave” of computing. 
   
      Since OpenAI opened up access to ChatGPT in late November, it has been used to write articles (with more than a couple factual inaccuracies) for at least one news publication; penned lyrics in the style of various artists (one of whom later responded, “this song sucks”) and drafted research paper abstracts that fooled some scientists. 
   
      Some CEOs have also already used the platform to write emails or do some accounting work. 
   
      OpenAI is also the company behind DALL-E, which generates a seemingly limitless range of images in response to prompts from users. Both DALL-E and ChatGPT are trained on vast amounts of data in order to generate content. 
   
      But there are some risks for Microsoft and OpenAI here. 
   
      While these products have gained traction among users, they’ve also raised some concerns, including about their potential to perpetuate biases and spread misinformation. At the same time, a growing number of schools and teachers are concerned about the immediate impact of ChatGPT on students and their ability to cheat on assignments.
   
      That could potentially create “much negative publicity” for the companies associated with these tools, said David Lobina, an artificial intelligence analyst at ABI Research.
   
      The opportunity is immense, however, and could boost Microsoft’s position in the growing arms race over artificial intelligence, and provide a helpful boost to OpenAI in the process. 
   
      “OpenAI is looking to monetize their systems, considering the huge compute costs of creating these models,” Lobina told CNN ahead of the announcement Monday. “Their partnership with Microsoft can be an easy way to do so.”

Fall Out Boy guitarist Joe Trohman has announced he is “stepping away” from the band for the sake of his mental health. 
   
      A statement from Trohman was posted to the band’s Twitter page late Wednesday night, along with a black and white picture of him playing the guitar. 
   
      The news came less than 24 hours after the band announced its new album “So Much (For) Stardust,” which will be released on March 24.
   
      Expressing his hope that the break would only be temporary, Trohman said: “Neil Young once howled that it’s better to burn out than to fade away. 
   
      “But I can tell you unequivocally that burning out is dreadful. Without divulging all the details, I must disclose that my mental health has rapidly deteriorated over the past several years. So, to avoid fading away and never returning, I will be taking a break from work which regrettably includes stepping away from Fall Out Boy for a spell.”
   
      He said that it “pains me to make this decision, especially when we are releasing a new album that fills me with great pride,” but added that he would 100% be returning “to the fold.”
   
      “In the meantime, I must recover which means putting myself and my mental health first.”
   
      The group’s co-founder thanked his bandmates, family and fans for “understanding and respecting this difficult, but necessary, decision.”
   
      Last year Trohman released his memoir called “None of This Rocks.” Published by Headline, the book covers, among other things, his struggles with depression and his mother’s mental illness.
   
      Fall Out Boy, also made up of Andy Hurley, Peter Wentz and Patrick Stump, formed in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette, Illinois, in 2001. Influenced by the city’s punk scene, they created a punkish pop music sound heard on their 2003 debut album “Take This to Your Grave.” Grammy-nominated for Best New Artist in 2006, their next album, “Infinity on High,” topped the Billboard chart at No. 1. Their song “This Ain’t a Scene, It’s an Arms Race” peaked at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in 2007.
   
      The group went on an “indefinite hiatus” in 2009 but in 2013 released a secretly recorded album called “Save Rock and Roll.”
   
      In an interview that year with CNN, Trohman said that the four of them had “needed a little time away from the band.”
   
      He added: “Guys are notoriously bad at emoting and communicating, and I think we had to learn how to do that. But also taking that time apart to be with our families, do other projects, work with different people and experience different things allowed us to come back and realize that maybe we did this thing not so well; maybe we should have talked more; maybe we shouldn’t have been so passive-aggressive; maybe this guy should have voiced his opinion more. I think we are better at that, and it has been very healthy for the band.”

      Last week, Richard Trumka Jr., a US Consumer Product Safety commissioner, sent emotions boiling over when he said in an interview with Bloomberg that the agency was considering banning gas stoves, citing the fact that over 12% of childhood asthma cases in the US are the result of gas stove usage. 
   
      Though the White House soon set the record straight, saying that “The President does not support banning gas stoves – and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is independent, is not banning gas stoves,” the momentary panic at the thought that Americans might be forced to cook with electricity revealed just how opinionated we are about what fuels our kitchens. 
   
      Chef Andrew Gruel, a restaurant owner and television personality, taped himself to his gas stove in protest of a possible gas ban. Others demonstrated by participating in a dangerous social media stunt in which they turned on all the burners on their stove and let the gas run.  
   
      But some had legitimate questions about how to cook without gas. Food writer and chef Alison Roman invited Twitter users to ask her anything about her induction stove, and the inquiries quickly flooded in. 
   
      “Can you toast marshmallows over it for s’mores?” 
   
      “Does the surface of the stovetop get all scratched to hell when you scoot pans around?” 
   
      “Does it heat things up (e.g. boil a pot of water) as fast as gas?” 
   
      While the consensus from Roman and other impassioned electric and induction stove users is that it is entirely possible to cook intricate and delectable meals sans gas, it’s clear that the general public has deep-seated misgivings about it. 
   
      But why? When it comes to most consumer products, we love upgrades and innovation. What is it about gas stoves that keep us from moving past this centuries-old technology?  
   
      The most obvious answer is public misconception. People seem convinced that it is much harder – perhaps even impossible – to cook a quality meal with electricity. And this perception was not created by accident. 
   
      As Grist reported, advertising by gas companies is largely responsible for popularizing gas stoves in kitchens by promoting them as a sign of wealth and high design. 
   
      Then there’s the trendsetting power of food icons and influencers. With the creations of culinary TV shows, food has taken on a new life as a spectator sport. And as we watch top chefs like Bobby Flay tossing a pan of sizzling morsels over an open flame, we want to emulate his style, stovetop and all.
   
      Meanwhile, the gas industry has tried to harness influencer power. According to Mother Jones, since at least 2018, influencers have been hired by trade groups to post over 100 pieces of content extolling the virtues of gas stoves. 
   
      There is something to be said for the visual feedback a chef gets watching a flame grow or shrink as they tinker with a heat dial. But for all the hype surrounding gas stoves, they have some serious drawbacks.  
 
      A growing body of research has detailed the numerous environmental and public health costs of cooking with gas. A study by Stanford University published last year found that the impacts of gas stoves are more significant than previously understood, due largely to the leakage of methane into the air. 
   
      Additional research has found that gas stoves emit carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter, and, without proper ventilation, their concentrations can reach levels deemed unsafe by the Environmental Protection Agency. In addition to the link between gas stoves and childhood asthma cited by Trumka, the stoves have also been linked to a slew of other health conditions from cardiovascular to cognitive issues.  
 
      Though proper ventilation with a fan or hood that leads outside can minimize health risks, according to CNN reporting, many homes don’t have adequate ventilation. 
   
      This should sound alarm bells for the 38% of American households that rely on gas for their cooking. 
   
      It should also sound the alarm for chefs in commercial kitchens that run on gas. 
   
      Chef Chris Galarza used to be one of them. The 33-year-old New Jersey native spent the formative years of his career cooking over a gas burner. The heat from the flames that licked the sides of his pans, combined with the constant stream of gas pollutants he was breathing in during his long shifts, often made the chef and his colleagues physically ill.  
   
      “In between rushes, we would go to the bathroom to throw up,” he recalls. “We were experiencing nausea, vomiting, headaches, lightheadedness,” symptoms which have been tied to indoor air pollution and extreme heat.  
 
      It wasn’t until Galarza happened to take a job in an all-electric kitchen and his symptoms disappeared that he started connecting the dots between his health and the gas stoves he had been accustomed to using. 
   
      “I realized, ‘Wow, I’ve been poisoning myself as a chef in the pursuit of my craft and my career.’ I began to ask myself, ‘Why am I doing this?’” It was then that Galarza decided he would center his career around helping commercial kitchens become electric. 
   
      In 2019, Galarza founded Forward Dining Solutions, a culinary consultancy dedicated to helping companies create fully-electric kitchens. As cities from coast to coast – including Berkley, San Francisco, New York City – have slowly started banning natural gas stoves in new buildings, Galarza has been there to not only help ease the transition to electric, but to educate chefs on why it is the way of the future. 
   
      And to the gas stove holdouts who remain skeptical that electric cooking can produce gourmet food, Galarza is here to allay your concerns. 
   
      “It’s not true at all that gas stoves cook better,” he says. “In fact, you can cook about 38.6 pounds of food per hour with your gas range, and it’s going to take time and elbow grease to clean and degrease it afterward.  With induction, you can cook 70.9 pounds of food per hour – nearly double the amount of food – and your clean up is going to be a lot easier.”
   
Induction stoves use electricity to create a magnetic field and generate heat right in the cookware instead of on the surface of the stovetop. “Because the stove itself doesn’t get as hot, if you spill something on your induction range, it won’t burn onto the surface or require scrubbing to remove,” explains Galarza. 
   
      For their part, some restaurants are also committing to electric appliances. Brooklyn pizzeria Oma Grassa has been lauded for the crispy texture of its pizza crust, which is made possible by an electric oven, the top and bottom of which can be headed to different temperatures. 
   
      There are, of course, some culinary feats that require an open flame – achieving a light, stovetop char on a tortilla without dirtying a pan, for instance. But, as one Twitter user pointed out: “You can like something without having to defend every single aspect of it. Almost all good things have drawbacks.”
   
This interview has been edited for length and clarity:
 
CNN: Tell me about your experience in kitchens with gas stoves at the start of your career. What was the environment like and how did you feel, both physically and mentally?
   
Chef Chris Galarza: The kitchens were hot. You’re supposed to be young and tough and have a bravado like “I’m going to conquer this kitchen, this kitchen is not going to conquer me.”  That’s the mentality. 
   
      I spoke to a chef once who said he would listen to heavy metal and do push-ups to prepare for being in the kitchen. And that mentality is important because you’re going to get incredibly busy incredibly fast. You’re going to have rushes of orders. Everyone will be frantic. 
   
      One of the kitchens I worked in was on the top floor of a building and in the summer, all the heat from the apartments and kitchens below would come up to the top kitchen where I was working. On one particular day, I looked down at a thermometer I had in my pocket and it read 135 degrees Fahrenheit. Naturally you try to drink a lot of water to stay cool – but that also has its downside: If you drink too much water, you throw off your body’s electrolyte balance and you get sick. 
   
      It wasn’t until I looked back on the experience once I started working in a fully electric kitchen that I realized a big part of the problem – part of the reason I felt so sick – was because I was cooking on gas stoves all day. 
   
CNN: How did you come to the realization that the symptoms were not only from the heat but also from the gasses you were breathing in? 
   
Galarza: When I moved to a fully electric kitchen, I started feeling healthier and more comfortable and like I could work with a clearer head. Without so many open flames, the kitchen stayed cooler, and because all the chefs were more comfortable, we all got along better. 
   
      Once I noticed this, I started doing research and learning about what’s in natural gas. I always thought of it as the clean burning fuel. But the idea that you can burn something and it’ll be clean is an oxymoron. As I started learning about formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and what they can do to your body, I started realizing that symptoms of exposure to these gasses were the same symptoms I had experienced in the gas-fueled kitchens: nausea, vomiting, headaches, lightheadedness. 
   
CNN: There seems to be a widespread perception of electricity-powered stoves as inferior to gas stoves. Can you explain why that’s not the case? 
   
Galarza: In many ways, induction stoves are actually superior to gas. They can cook about double the amount of food per hour because there’s very little wasted energy. Up to 90% of the energy generated is transferred to the food in induction cooking. 
   
      A gas range, by comparison, is a little over 30% efficient. Up to about 70% of the energy escapes into your surroundings and doesn’t even make it to the food. That means you’re throwing out 70 cents per dollar, and spending more money on electricity to cool the space back down. 
   
      But with induction, the energy is generated in the cookware extremely quickly. The truest test: you can boil water more quickly with induction than with gas. 
   
CNN: One common complaint that I’ve heard is that you can’t cook with a wok on an induction stovetop. Is that true? 
   
Galarza: There are induction woks made just for this purpose and, yes, you’re still able to toss everything around, just like you can in a wok on a gas range. Woks are unique because of their structure. In the center they’re hotter, while up the sides they’re cooler, so you’re able to cook different things that have different temperature needs all at once. 
   
      There’s a culinary term “wok hei,” which translates to the “breath of the wok.” It refers to the way a wok cooks and the flavor it imparts. Induction cooking is able to replicate wok hei beautifully and has been touted by chefs such as Martin Yan as the future of cooking.
   
CNN: Are there any downsides to cooking without gas on a flameless stove? 
   
Galarza: The major perceived con for induction is that you can’t see a flame. With gas, you associate the size of the flame with the amount of heat you’re cooking with. But with induction, you have to rely on the dial setting to know the power level. 
   
      Some people may find it hard to gauge what a “10” on the dial equates to in terms of heat. When I train folks, I always say, “Don’t be alarmed. The first thing you try to cook, you’re going to burn.” 
   
      Your instinct is going to be to crank the dial to high and not realize how much power you’re cooking with. It has happened to all of my staff. Obviously, with a little practice, that can be mitigated, but I always tell folks to expect a learning curve.
   
      It just means you have to tune into your other senses. When you hear a sizzle, you know something is searing; when you smell smoke, it’s probably burning. We don’t need a flame to tell us what’s happening in the pan. The food will tell us what it needs or when it’s ready to be flipped over.
   
CNN: What about cookware? Can the same pots and pans that are used on a gas stove be used on an induction stove?
   
Galarza: If you use pure copper or aluminum pots and pans, then switching from gas to an induction stovetop may require you to buy new cookware. For many people though, chances are that the cookware you already use on your gas stove will work just fine on an induction stove. 
   
      You can test it by seeing if a magnet will stick to the bottom of your cookware. If it sticks, your pots and pans can be used on an induction stove.
   
CNN: What are the primary reasons you think people are resistant to moving away from their gas stoves? 
   
Galarza:  Cooking is very emotional for folks. It’s spiritual for a lot of people. My great grandfather belonged to a tribe in the Amazon rainforest, so I’ve thought to myself “Man, maybe one day I’m going to inherit recipes from his tribe and I’m going to be connected to my ancestors in a way that I never thought possible.” 
   
      So I can understand the primal, humanistic draw to one’s heritage – that sense of getting back to your roots. People may see fire and think, “This is how my mother and grandmother cooked.”  
   
      But we’ve also now been inundated with marketing about how great cooking with gas is. Influencers are being paid to say things like “Hey, I couldn’t imagine cooking without gas! #CookingWithGas.” And that marketing is very effective. 
   
      Part of the problem is that food has become less about eating since the invention of social media. Now people think, “If I take a picture with this big flame, it’s going to look really cool and it’s going to get a lot of likes.” As chefs, we laugh at that, because having flames all over the place won’t do anything for your food –  it’s flashy, but you’re not controlling your heat. 
   
CNN: What do you think it would take to start changing the popular perception about cooking with gas and electricity?
   
Galarza: I can answer that with a story. Do you know why lobster is so popular? It used to be the thing that fishermen couldn’t sell. People thought it was poor people’s food. They would say, “That’s just trash. We don’t eat that. Leave that for the fishermen to eat.” And now the lobster is considered a symbol of opulence, right? 
   
      The lobster hasn’t changed – people’s perception of it has changed. Now it’s one of the most expensive things on the menu and we’re willing to pay for it. 
   
      The moral of the story is that popular perception can change – it just takes an effort to change it. 
   
CNN: Who do you think has the power – or perhaps the responsibility – to help change that public perception? 
   
Galarza: That’s something I’ve been thinking about a lot. How do we start to nudge people to choose electric on their own? I think it’s going to take a community of folks who want to encourage electric cooking to start talking about it. 
   
      It’s going to take the American Culinary Federation, which is the governing body of chefs. It’s going to take celebrity chefs. It’s going to take the scientific community doing more research on the impact of gas appliances in restaurants. 
   
      People need to start hearing the truth: there’s no conspiracy or cabal coming to take your gas. We just want what’s best for you, your family and our industry. 
   
      I’m just one guy talking about induction – but there are a lot of us who use it and are passionate about it. I encourage the David Changs of the world, the Bobby Flays of the world, the Food Networks and Cooking Channels of the world to say, “Hey, let’s talk about the fuel we’re cooking with. Let’s show how food can be the catalyst for change we need.”
   
      If viewers were to see Bobby Flay cooking on an induction stove, it would start changing their minds. They would realize this is the next evolution of cooking. The future is here. And the future is awesome.

      Global oil demand is expected to hit its highest-ever level this year on the back of China’s swift reopening of its economy. 
   
      Oil demand could surge by 1.9 million barrels per day to reach a record 101.7 million barrels per day, the International Energy Agency said in its latest monthly report, released Wednesday. 
   
      “China will drive nearly half this global demand growth even as the shape and speed of its reopening remains uncertain,” the IEA said. 
   
      Beijing began to dismantle its strict zero-Covid policy in December, paving the way for a rebound in travel, trade and business activity across the world’s second-biggest economy. Most economists expect growth to remain sluggish in the first quarter of 2023 before picking up over the rest of the year. 
   
      The rebound in Chinese demand could lead to a tighter global oil market as the “full impact” of Western sanctions on Russian oil starts to bite, the IEA said in the report. 
   
      The Paris-based agency said that oil exports from Russia dropped by 200,000 barrels per day on average in December from the previous month after the European Union imposed a ban on imports of Moscow’s crude and G7 nations imposed a cap on the price at which the fuel could be traded. 
   
      Prices for Brent crude, the global benchmark, tumbled last year after hitting a 14-year high of $139 a barrel in early March after Russia invaded Ukraine. Prices started to recover in early December, and ticked up 1.7% on Wednesday to hit $87 a barrel. 
   
      Where prices could go next is unclear. The IEA said there was a “high degree of uncertainty” over its outlook. Despite an expected drop in supply from Russia, global oil inventories are at their highest levels since October 2021. 
   
      A boom in demand for electric vehicles and countries’ efforts to become more energy efficient could also help temper demand, the agency said. 
   
      “Measures like these are especially vital in a supply-constrained oil market,” it added. 
   
      The IEA’s forecasts come as business leaders express cautious optimism that the world can avoid a recession in 2023, after months of gloomy forecasts about the economic outlook.
   
      That’s thanks in large part to China, whose reopening is expected to unleash a wave of spending that may offset economic weakness in the United States and Europe.
   
      Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund said that about one third of the world economy would this year likely fall into recession — typically defined as two or more consecutive quarters of declining growth.
   
      In November, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies started slashing their oil output by 2 million barrels per day, a policy set to continue through 2023, as it forecast a drop in demand.

232,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Silvia Marchetti, CNN",Italy's Friuli region is one of Europe's best kept secrets,"Its mountains, canyons, beaches and lagoons make it one of Italy's most beautiful and varied landscapes, but few people -- and that includes Italians -- know anything about Friuli Venezia Giulia.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/friuli-venezia-giulia-italy-region/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230116153931-01-friuli-italy-region-super-tease.jpg,2023-01-18T10:39:42Z,"
      Its mountains, canyons, beaches and lagoons make it one of Italy’s most beautiful and varied landscapes, but few people – and that includes Italians – know anything about it. 
   
      Perhaps because it’s tucked away on the country’s northeastern border with Slovenia and Austria, perhaps because of a history of invasions, including the Austro-Hungarian empire, or perhaps because of the many languages spoken by locals, it barely seems like part of Italy.
   
      But although Friuli Venezia Giulia stretches from the snow-capped Alpine reaches of the Dolomites to the sun-kissed waters of the northern Adriatic sea, it never experiences the crowds that leave some parts of Italy straining in the summer.
   
      And yet, say locals, it’s every bit as worth visiting as the rest of Italy.
   
      “Unlike other Italian regions, we’re not advertised and are far from mass tourism,” says local tour guide Roberta Bressan. “Ours is a small-scale, niche reality travelers should discover bit by bit, made of a constellation of beautiful tiny towns and different traditions.”
   
      One of the region’s biggest selling points is its scenery. With 13 natural reserves and the pristine park of the Friuli Dolomite Mountains, the region lures tourists seeking to connect with nature or explore the outdoors. 
   
      “It’s a green, heavenly patch. You can go biking and trekking in the Dolomites’ park and kayaking along mountain springs and rock tunnels with fluorescent blue waters,” says local travel blogger Luca Vivan. 
   
      Friuli’s verdant valleys are surrounded by Alpine peaks which, on clear days, offer views all the way down to the coast. Labyrinths of caves, ravines and canyons with waterfalls and fast-flowing rivers dot the vast karst limestone plateau at the feet of the hills.
   
      Outdoor activities happen all year round. Warmer weather brings hang gliding flights, kayaking in turquoise clear rivers, sailing, windsurfing and rock climbing. In winter, there’s skiing and sledding in cozy resorts like Tarvisio, Tolmezzo and Piancavallo.
   
      Geological wonders include the underwater cave of Gorgazzo lake, with its incredible tropical blue-green colors. There’s also the spellbinding Grotta Gigante, or Giant Cave, one of the world’s largest tourist caverns. 
   
      There are trekking trails that follow the rock-embedded footprints and skeletons of dinosaurs and old shepherd routes that connect sleepy hamlets.
   
      Friuli is also a sunbathers’ hotspot.
   
      The lagoon island-town of Grado, which resembles a miniature Venice, is as close as Friuli gets to a popular vacation resort while Lignano Sabbiadoro is one long peninsula of golden beaches.
   
      Trieste boasts an unusual segregated beach, with origins dating back several centuries. Visitors to Bagno all Lanterna are divided into men and women, and kept apart by a white wall running up the middle of the beach. 
   
      “Residents are very fond and proud of this place,” says Trieste local Maria Bonacci. “They see it as embodying avant-garde same-sex freedom, and the beach’s popularity keeps growing even among youth.”
   
      Trieste is a destination in its own right. Friuli’s capital is sometimes known as Italy’s Little Vienna because its Austro-Hungarian heritage is reflected in the majestic Mitteleuropean architecture and decadent fin de siècle vibe. 
   
      The city also boasts one of Europe’s largest squares, Piazza Unità D’Italia, overlooking the sea and surrounded by elegant palazzos showing off the sumptuous imperial grandeur of the past – a fading decadence, complete with historical cafes, that has long attracted artists and writers, such as Ireland’s James Joyce.
   
      Bonacci believes what makes Friuli Venezia Giulia unique is its “dual soul.”
   
      She says the juxtaposition of the imperial grandeur is reflected in cities such as Trieste and the rural, interior mountainous areas made of “silent secret villages where ancient traditions survive.”
   
      Strong bora winds that sometimes buffet Trieste with gusts of up to 160 kilometers per hour also help power the Barcolana, one of the world’s largest sailing regattas, which attracts more than 2,000 boats of all sizes every October. 
   
      Friuli’s smaller towns are also worth exploring. Udine is a small-scale Venice with luxuriant gardens. Gorizia, on the border with Slovenia, is known as Italy’s Salzburg. The UNESCO-listed Cividale del Friuli has a picturesque medieval center overlooking the aquamarine Natisone River.
   
      For fans of archeology, there’s the city of Aquileia, the ancient Roman capital of Friuli, which has an impressive basilica featuring a huge paleo-Christian floor mosaic that depicts symbolic animals and the tree of life.
   
      Aristocratic glamor is everywhere. The region boasts an incredible array of fascinating castles and fortresses which hark to its wealthy and powerful past. 
   
      The Miramare Castle is Trieste’s jewel, built by Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Habsburg as a luxurious retreat in the 19th century. Perched on a promontory and surrounded by a luxuriant park it boasts a spectacular view of the Gulf of Trieste.
   
      One stunning castle, which is also a luxury resort, is Castello di Spessa where it’s said the infamous Venetian lover Giacomo Casanova sojourned during one of his journeys and, predictably, had an affair with a maid. Today, guests can sleep in his extravagant suite. 
   
      But Friuli also has a “primeval” bucolic soul. It is dotted with tiny old hamlets where farming traditions and folklore live on.
   
      The hamlet of Sappada is a remote German-speaking enclave and skiing resort with traditional, unusual slant-roofed wooden dwellings known as blockbau. Winters offer silent landscapes of snowy blankets.
   
      Pesariis is an Alpine village famous for huge artisan clocks that decorate its alleys while nearby Sauris is known for its traditional beers and speck – a cured and smoked ham.
   
      Cordovado, Toppo and Fagagna, villages with intact medieval districts and a sleepy ambiance, seem frozen in time and are part of Italy’s Most Beautiful Villages club.
   
      The citadel-fortress of Palmanova is a Renaissance jewel of Venetian origins shaped like a nine-pointed star. Legend has it that Leonardo Da Vinci designed it as an “ideal city.”
   
      Local guide Bressan, who offers tailored tours of the region, recommends navigating along Grado’s lagoon while lunching on regional seafood dishes, seeing Friuli’s medieval isolated rural chapels, exploring the Karst Plateau in fall “when colors are like an artist’s palette,” and visiting former mining centers, such as Cludinico, which are now open-air museums.
   
      Friuli’s “war tours” are also quite popular, says Bressan. “I often organize day trips for passengers arriving on cruise ships in Trieste. American families long to see the places where their fathers or grandparents served during World War II, and they already know where to go and what to see.”
   
      Friuli is one of Italy’s premium winemaking regions, with its fragrant, elegant whites and sparkling alternatives to the country’s more well-known Prosecco.
   
      The two top vineyard areas are the Collio and the Colli Orientali del Friuli. Another estate, Ronco dei Tassi, is named after the badgers (“tassi” in Italian) that nibble on the mature grapes of the terraced sloping vines.
   
      Friuli goes big on aperitivo culture. The Spritz, an iconic alcoholic drink introduced during Austrian rule, was originally made with white wine mixed with sparkling water. Today, Aperol or Campari and Prosecco are mixed to give it an orange hue – and it’s an Italian classic. 
   
      Great wines pair well with succulent cured meats.
   
      The hilltop town of San Daniele is renowned for a sweetish ham that’s cured in both the Adriatic breeze and cool mountain air. The village also makes a little-known smoked trout known as the Queen of San Daniele – the ham being the king.
   
      Other local delicacies can be sampled in the many no-frills frasche and osmize taverns, run by farmers, that serve local handmade cheeses, such as Montasio and Asino alongside a variety of cured meats. 
   
      Pitina is a strong-flavored salami made with goat, sheep and roe deer meat. “Underground” cheeses, seasoned in Karsic caves, are a top delicacy. 
   
      Classic Friuli dishes include a pork and vegetable soup called jota, handmade prune and blueberry gnocchi, ravioli stuffed with chocolate and cinnamon, and frico, a potato cake with fried Montasio cheese and onions. 
   
      Another specialty is musèt con la brovada, a cotechino pork sausage served with turnips fermented with grape marc.
   
      There are many brodetto fish soups, including the busara, a dish of shrimp with black pepper, grated bread and tomatoes. Trieste’s speciality is sardoni in savor, a layered dish of anchovies and onions. Grado is renowned for its small, tasty boreto de baci clams. 
   
      For dessert, palacinche are sugary omelets while the putizza is a traditional roll cake made with chocolate, dried fruit and honey.
   
      Italians call Friuli’s cuisine mare e monti (sea-and-mountains) – the landscape of available seafood, vegetables and meat delicacies being just as varied and spectacular as the surrounding scenery.

      It happened again. Thousands of supporters of Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro stormed the country’s government buildings on January 8 in protest of their newly sworn-in president. The riots occurred almost two years to the day after the assault on the US Capitol by supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump.
   
      The similarities are striking: the violence and vulgarity of the attacks against democratic institutions and the aim to sow chaos while claiming to be law and order. In both cases, political leaders questioned  the results of elections, and, in general, the values of democracy.
   
      Over half the world’s population lives under authoritarian regimes, and movements that clearly call individual and public freedoms into question and foster xenophobia persist at the ballot box. There are many reasons for this, but among them is a near-universal sense of grievance. So many citizens around the world suffer from economic hardship while a sliver of the population — the wealthy and the corporations they own and control — is doing extremely well. 
   
      As the world faces a decade of crises, it’s time for those who benefit to pay their fair share to help alleviate these grievances. And that can partly be done through taxes. 
   
      Take, for example, the coronavirus. Three years after the emergence of Covid-19, a jarring disconnect has emerged between the human toll and the historic profits of many large companies, money which benefitted shareholders, who cashed in on a bonanza of dividends, stock buybacks and sky-high share prices. The pharmaceutical giants have made billions in profits from Covid-19 vaccines, which they wouldn’t have been able to develop without university research and government subsidies. And Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine has allowed energy and food corporations to increase profit margins by 256% in 2022 — compared with the 2018 to 2021 average — even as ordinary families struggle to pay their bills. The shareholders of these companies received $257 billion — or 84% of windfall profits — last year alone, according to an Oxfam report, “Survival of the Richest,” published this week to coincide with Davos.
   
      These exorbitant corporate profits are not a result of hard work or sudden creativity. They’re a result of the political situation. The war caused energy prices to soar, especially the cost of natural gas. And many food products produced in the region, such as wheat, became inaccessible, which prompted food prices to skyrocket. With these high prices came undeserved windfall profits. And they should be taxed at a higher rate than corporations usually pay.
   
      A well-designed tax on windfall profits — which would vary country to country — can both spur investment and raise revenue. The revenue would enable countries to fund increased public services — like health care, education and access to water and sanitation — that can help all citizens, especially the most vulnerable. The tax would also help nations build the infrastructure needed to face the existential challenge of climate change, such as clean energy services, green transportation and energy-efficient buildings. Several countries in Europe have already begun to implement a windfall tax. 
   
      For the same reasons, it is urgent to tax the richest, some of whom get away with paying hardly any tax these days thanks to tax havens, among other strategies. Oxfam argues, correctly in my view, that there is something fundamentally wrong with a world-order in which a man like Elon Musk, one of the richest in history, is actually taxed at just 3.3%, while Aber Christine, a poor flour vendor in Uganda, is taxed at 40%. It is a gap even more shocking than the one Warren Buffett denounced almost 12 years ago, later explaining that he paid taxes at a lower rate than his secretary. Since 2020, the richest 1% have captured almost two-thirds of all new wealth. 
   
      Making the wealthiest pay their fair share to finance the expansion of rights such as universal access to health care and education is not actually a radical or even exotic idea. In the aftermath of World War II, the United States made it one of its main tools for reconstruction, instituting one of the highest marginal peacetime tax rates in the world of 91% in 1951, which was then increased to 92% the following year. At the same time, taxes on corporate profits were 50%. Even as recently as 1980, the top marginal income tax rate on the richest was 70%. 
   
      Since then, politicians have systematically cut virtually every tax that fell on the wealthy, from high-end income taxes and investment taxes, to estate and corporate taxes, to inheritance taxes, claiming the whole economy would benefit. You know the rest: Inequality in the US and countries around the world soared, working-class wages stagnated, working conditions deteriorated, and debts ballooned. As for the richest, they have done amazingly well, but they are the only ones. The same pattern has been repeated all over the world, with political consequences we are seeing in action. 
   
      With the inflation crisis, it is impossible to continue avoiding the debate. As we at the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT) believe, progressive taxation — making those with the broadest shoulders actually pay their fair share — is one of the most powerful tools to reduce inequality and build more resilient and inclusive societies. To refuse this solution is to force states to institute austerity programs, cutting public services and retirement benefits. This is a recipe for a chaos far greater than what we saw in Washington, D.C. and Brasilia. And that is a price too steep for the world to pay.

Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo put on a show as they came head to head in Paris Saint-Germain’s 5-4 win over a Riyadh All-Star XI on Thursday. 
   
      The exhibition match was played in Saudi Arabia’s capital and saw the two superstars renew their storied rivalry for possibly the last time. 
   
      Despite being a friendly, the game was played at a furious pace as a packed out crowd inside the King Fahd Stadium was treated to a goal-fest between the French champion and a team consisting of the best players from Saudi’s domestic league. 
   
      It was Messi who opened the scoring with a well taken finish within three minutes before Ronaldo equalized from the penalty spot after colliding with PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas. 
   
      Juan Bernat was then sent off for the French giant after bringing down Salem Al Dawsari as the last man, before defender Marquinhos reestablished PSG’s lead by turning in a wonderful cross from Kylian Mbappé. 
   
      The breathtaking action continued with Neymar seeing his penalty saved before Ronaldo leveled the scores 2-2 before the break when he reacted quickest after his initial header hit the post. 
   
      The Portugal international has yet to make his debut since moving to Al Nassr after the World Cup, but he delighted the crowds on Thursday by performing his trademark celebration.
   
      The 37-year-old is set to make his debut on Sunday as Al Nassr hosts Ettifaq at Mrsool Park.
   
      There was no let up in the second half with Sergio Ramos putting PSG back ahead after more brilliant work from Mbappé, before Jang Hyun-soo’s header leveled proceedings again. 
   
      Mbappé then got on the score sheet himself after converting another penalty before both Ronaldo and Messi were substituted after the hour mark. 
   
      Even without the two big names on the pitch, the game continued at a frantic pace and youngster Hugo Ekitike eventually put PSG out of sight after calmly finishing off a counterattack.
   
      There was still time, though, for Anderson Talisca to convert a long-range effort which ended up serving as little more than a consolation.
   
      The exhibition game was more than organizers could have dreamed of with all the biggest stars playing a part in a thrilling encounter. 
   
      “Players from our league relished the opportunity to pit their talents against some of the best players in the world, such as Kylian Mbappé, Neymar, Achraf Hakimi, and, of course, Lionel Messi,” Saudi Pro League chairman AdbulAziz Al-Afaleq said in a statement. 
   
      “Backed by an incredibly passionate crowd at the King Fahd International Stadium, the Saudi Pro League players truly put in a performance to be proud of that showcased the strength of Saudi Arabian football.”
   
      However, the match has been criticized by Amnesty International, which says the game was another example of sportswashing – a phenomenon whereby corrupt or autocratic regimes invest in sport and sports events to whitewash their international reputation – from both Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which bankrolls PSG through the company Qatar Sports Investments. 
   
      “Ronaldo’s big-money transfer to Al Nassr and Messi’s engagement by the Saudi authorities as a tourism ambassador are both part of Riyadh’s aggressive sportswashing programme, with the authorities seeking to exploit the celebrity appeal of elite sport to deflect attention from the country’s appalling human rights record,” Peter Frankental, Amnesty UK’s economic affairs director, said in a statement. 
   
      He added: “Saudi Arabia’s extensive use of sport as an exercise in soft power is well-known, but with Qatari-owned PSG appearing in Riyadh we effectively have two sportswashing superpowers – Saudi Arabia and Qatar – flexing their muscles.
   
      “Saudi Arabia and Qatar have both poured vast amounts of money into sporting ventures in a bid to rebrand themselves and switch international attention away from their human rights records – efforts which have been only partially successful.
   
      “Footballers like Ronaldo and Messi have huge profiles and we’d like to see them resisting being used as the famous faces of sportswashing, including by speaking out about human rights issues in both Saudi Arabia and Qatar.”

Now it's off the endangered species list,The Fender's blue butterfly has fluttered away from the brink of extinction.,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/21/us/fenders-blue-butterfly-endangered-scn-trnd/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230119112950-fenders-blue-butterfly.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-01-21T15:07:35Z,"
      The Fender’s blue butterfly has fluttered away from the brink of extinction.
   
      The species, once so rare it was thought to be extinct, is no longer considered endangered, according to a January 11 news release from the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The organization reclassified the species from “endangered” to “threatened” and also finalized a rule to make it easier for landowners to manage the species.
   
      “This is a tremendous success story – to go from nearly extinct to on the road to recovery,” Craig Rowland, acting state supervisor for the service’s Oregon office, said in the release. “We’ve only reached this point of being able to downlist because of successful partnerships with landowners, conservation agencies, businesses, other agencies, and the work of our national wildlife refuges to conserve Fender’s butterfly.
   
      “This is yet another species that is making incredible strides in Oregon,” he added.
   
      The reclassification will take effect February 13, according to the release.
   
      The Fender’s blue butterfly is found only in Oregon’s Willamette Valley – a 150-mile long region in the state that stretches from Portland to Eugene – says the service. The species was thought to be extinct in 1937 but was later rediscovered in 1989. Thanks to local conservation efforts, the butterfly’s population expanded from approximately 3,391 insects in 2000 to 13,700 in 2018, according to a species assessment from the Fish and Wildlife Service.
 
      For Sujud Ottman, a biology and urban agriculture teacher at Evanston Township High School in Illinois and an amateur butterfly conservationist, the species’ recovery is a “sign of hope” for other endangered species.
   
      Ottman told CNN the Fender’s blue butterfly is unique because it prefers to lay its eggs on one host plant, Kincaid’s lupine. This makes the survival of the butterfly and the plant deeply intertwined. Kincaid’s lupine is also categorized as “threatened” by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
 
      The insects are also interesting because of their life cycle, Ottman added. The Fender’s caterpillars enter a kind of delayed development called diapause during the winter before emerging as fully formed butterflies. The adults live for only around 10 days, during which they must find a mate and reproduce.
   
      Ottman said habitat loss and the human prevention of natural wildfires are the main threats to the Fender’s blue butterfly. Wildfires are necessary to prevent the prairie habitat the butterflies depend on from turning into forests. 
   
      Conservation efforts included planting thousands of Kincaid’s lupine for the butterflies to lay their eggs on as well as prescribed fires to maintain the crucial prairie environment.
   
      The species’ reclassification is “wonderful news,” Ottman added. “It’s super inspirational, to know that a butterfly that was once thought of as extinct is now de-listed off of the endangered species list.
   
      “It’s truly remarkable, and it gives me a lot of hope.”
   
      As pollinators, butterflies are a crucial component of our ecosystems, she explained. That’s part of why protecting endangered butterflies is so important. “I feel like this story is, well, really empowering and I hope it lights a fire within to continue conservation efforts that they’re doing,” she said.
   
      For Ottman, the Fender’s blue butterfly’s recovery may signal hope for other endangered butterfly species, like the iconic monarch butterfly. Monarchs were classified as “endangered” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in July 2022.
   
      “My dream is for the monarch to basically follow the footsteps of the Fender’s blue butterfly, and, you know, thrive, as well,” she said. “I believe that we can do it, and that we can reverse the damage that we’ve done.”

      In a letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan opposing nearly a dozen media organizations request to make the identities of the co-signers known, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers described the incident.

      The world economy is still in a sticky spot, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund, despite cautious optimism among economists and business leaders that slowing inflation means the worst of last year’s crises may be over. 
   
      Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, said on Friday that conditions in the world economy were “less bad” than feared a few months ago, but further pain could be on the way. 
   
      Addressing a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Georgieva said interest rate hikes by the world’s major economies had “yet to bite,” and could increase unemployment — a situation that cash-strapped governments could find hard to respond to adequately. 
   
      “It is very different for a consumer to have [a] cost-of-living crisis and a job, than to have [a] cost-of-living crisis and no job,” she said. 
   
      Last year, most of the world’s central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, started aggressively hiking interest rates in an attempt to control runaway inflation triggered, in large part, by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that sent energy prices soaring. 
   
      ECB President Christine Lagarde vowed, during Friday’s discussion, to “stay the course” in bumping up the cost of borrowing to bring inflation down to the central bank’s 2% target. 
   
      For its part, the Fed also remains laser-focused on reaching the 2% target. Policy will have to remain restrictive for “some time” to come, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said on Thursday. “We are determined to stay the course.”
   
      And both the IMF and ECB heads cautioned that China’s reopening of its economy following the abandonment of its strict zero-Covid policy threatened to push up prices of commodities, including oil and natural gas, as demand picks up later this year. 
   
      “The amount of LNG [liquefied natural gas] that [China] will be buying from the rest of the world will be higher than we have seen… there will be more inflationary pressure coming out of that added demand in commodities, and energy in particular,” Lagarde said. 
   
      That could weigh on global growth, which the IMF forecast in October would slump to 2.7% this year, down from 3.2% in 2022.
   
      Even so, economists and business leaders have signaled in recent weeks that the world economy may be at a hopeful turning point. 
   
      Inflation in the United States and Europe is trending downwards, supply chain bottlenecks are easing, and the risk of energy rationing in Europe this winter has been averted. China’s reopening has helped buoy markets in Asia.
   
      Lagarde said that economies are moving from “defense mode…to competition mode.”
   
      “So something must be getting better,” she added.

      In a nation beset by gun violence and that levies too few consequences on irresponsible gun owners and users, it’s pretty surprising to see that actor Alec Baldwin will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in New Mexico after a tragic accident on the set of the film “Rust” in October 2021. 
   
      Authorities say Baldwin was using a gun he was handed by an assistant director, which he had no reason to believe was loaded with a live round – and indeed, the assistant director reportedly told the people on set that it was a “cold gun.”
 
      Baldwin was doing a “cross draw” – pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. In the scene, Baldwin was told to point the gun toward the camera lens. 
   
      That was when director Joel Souza said he heard “what sounded like a whip and then a loud pop.” A shot went off, striking cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in the chest and killing her. A bullet also hit Souza in the shoulder, but he survived. 
   
      Baldwin denies he pulled the trigger, saying he only pulled back the hammer and released it.
   
      At first glance, the charges against Baldwin, which have been welcomed by Hutchins’ family, seem extreme. 
   
      While I don’t believe there are many true “accidents” involving guns – it’s hard to bring a weapon designed to maim and kill into the picture and then find yourself surprised when that weapon maims or kills – the wholly aberrational circumstances of this shooting do make it seem like a freak occurrence.  
   
      Movie sets have layers of professionals and safety protocols to ensure that things like this don’t happen, which is precisely why things like this don’t typically happen (the last high-profile incident like this one was when Brandon Lee was shot and killed on the set of “The Crow” in 1993 when a co-star fired a prop gun that was loaded with a real bullet). 
   
      Yes, usually it is the responsibility of the person holding that gun to not point it at anyone unless they intend to shoot; it is usually the responsibility of the person holding the gun to know for sure whether or not it’s loaded by checking the carriage before they do anything else. 
   
      But this was a movie set, where responsibilities are delegated and actors have every reason to believe that the guns they are being handed are props – or at least unloaded, or loaded with blanks. 
   
      I would guess that a great many actors have never held, owned or fired a gun outside of a movie set. Just like many actors have never, outside of a movie set, scaled a building, performed surgery, won a sword fight, given birth or walked flawlessly in stilettos. 
   
      It’s acting in the movies – by definition, a space of fantasy and falsity and faking it. Which is why there’s a team of pros nearby to make the faking look real. 
   
      Baldwin the actor, in other words, perhaps didn’t behave perfectly – he could have checked the gun, although it’s not clear that actors doing so is industry standard. 
   
According to New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, other “A-list” actors have told her that they “always check their guns or have someone check it in front of them.” 
   
      But according to Dutch Merrick, a studio armorer and instructor, that’s not the case: “There is no hard-and-fast rule that says an actor must check a gun,” he told the New York Times.
 
      The union representing film and television actors, SAG-AFTRA, said in a statement that the “prosecutor’s contention that an actor has a duty to ensure the functional and mechanical operation of a firearm on a production set is wrong and uninformed.” They continued: “an actor’s job is not to be a firearms or weapons expert.” 
   
      And Baldwin, for his part, said that throughout his career it has not been a standard for actors to check their guns.
   
      It doesn’t seem wholly unreasonable for Baldwin to have relied on the multiple professionals around him whose job it was to ensure that the gun was safe. Under these truly unusual and specific circumstances, it’s hard to say he should be on the hook for involuntary manslaughter. 
   
      But: Baldwin wasn’t just an actor in this film; he was a producer as well, and therefore, arguably, had an elevated level of responsibility for on-set safety. If this gun firing was a one-off, perhaps one could still safely say that this was a tragedy, not a crime. 
   
      The shooting that killed a bright, talented cinematographer, though, was not the only safety issue on set. 
   
      There were reportedly two accidental gun discharges on set just days before the shooting. Six members of the camera crew had walked off the set shortly before the shooting – not for issues with the guns or props, but in objection to being over-worked and paid late. 
   
      Dave Halls, the assistant director who handed Baldwin the gun, has been the subject of complaints on previous movie sets for allegedly lax safety standards. And one crew member called it “the most unorganized set I’ve ever seen.”
   
      Baldwin, for his part, blames both Gutierrez-Reed and Halls, saying he feels terrible about what happened but it isn’t his fault; those two in turn say through their lawyers that Baldwin is deflecting responsibility. 
 
According to industry professionals, both the armorer and the assistant director – in this case, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and Halls – should have checked the chamber before telling Baldwin the gun was cold and safe to use and should have demonstrated as much in front of him. 
   
      Gutierrez-Reed was reportedly off set the day of the shooting because of Covid-19 protocols, which limited the number of people who could be there. The accidental discharges in particular point to a set that wasn’t being run as safely as it needed to be – and the buck there stops with the producers, including Baldwin.
   
      Baldwin’s attorney Luke Nikas told CNN in a statement that Baldwin and his legal team feel “blindsided” by the charges as they alleged they were not given any indication the actor and producer would face criminal charges. Nikas said the decision to charge Baldwin “distorts Halyna Hutchin’s tragic death and represents a terrible miscarriage of justice.” 
   
In New Mexico, “Involuntary manslaughter consists of manslaughter committed in the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to felony, or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death in an unlawful manner or without due caution and circumspection.” 
   
      It’s that second clause that prosecutors seem to be applying to Baldwin. And so the question is: Did Baldwin act without due caution and circumspect? 
   
      One outstanding question is why live rounds were on set in the first place, and it seems police are investigating that question. 
   
      Gutierrez-Reed will reportedly be charged as well. Her attorney Jason Bowles issued a statement to CNN condemning the decision to charge her saying “we expect that she will be found not guilty by a jury and she did not commit manslaughter.”
   
      Halls, who handed Baldwin the gun and said it was cold, has pleaded to negligent use of a deadly weapon, and has received a suspended sentence. 
   
      And Seth Kenney, the man whose company sent ammunition to the “Rust” set, has been sued by Gutierrez-Reed, who alleges he and his company improperly sent live bullets instead of dummies. Kenney says his company only sent dummies. 
   
      A charge is not a conviction, and a judge still has to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to allow the case to move forward. 
   
      At the very least, this is a crucial reminder in a nation that is obsessed with firearms – in the movies and in real life – that deadly weapons beget deadly outcomes, and that there are no true “accidents” when it comes to gun violence: there is only a lack of responsibility.

      The first time Johanna Thomas talked to the families of her kids’ friends about gun safety, she had to work up her nerve.
   
      It was after a school event, and a girl had invited her daughter to drive home with her family for a playdate, said the mother of two kids from Fayetteville, Arkansas. The volunteer for the gun safety advocacy group Moms Demand Action wanted to make sure that whatever firearms the family had were not accessible to her daughter, she said — so she asked. 
   
      The girl’s mother told her the family didn’t have any in the home but did have one in the car that was kept under a seat, Thomas said.

She realized her children might have more unsafe access to guns outside of her home than she thought, and she knew she would have to start making more safety plans, said Thomas, an associate professor of social work at the University of Arkansas and educator on gun violence prevention through the Be SMART program. (SMART is short for secure, model, ask, recognize and tell.)
   
      Families across the United States were horrified to see recent reports of a 6-year-old boy in Newport News, Virginia, who is accused of bringing his family’s gun to school and shooting his teacher, but the tragedy involving a child with access to guns is part of a troubling broader trend.
   
      In a five-year period leading up to 2021, there were 2,070 unintentional shootings by children under 18 in the US, according to a report from Everytown for Gun Safety. Those shootings resulted in 765 deaths and 1,366 injuries. 
   
      And from March through December 2020, the number of unintentional shooting deaths by children rose by 31% compared with the same period in 2019, according to Everytown.
   
      Having firearms in the home does increase the risk of an injury, but for many families, removing guns is not an option, said Dr. Lois Lee, an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston. The next best option is to make sure firearms are stored safely.
   
      Talking about gun safety when it comes to your kids and community doesn’t need to be a political issue, said Cassandra Crifasi, associate professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. It may feel uncomfortable, but the focus can stay on minimizing the risk of exposure.  
   
      “We can protect kids, we can reduce a lot of gun violence, just by normalizing the conversation around firearms,” Thomas said.
   
      When you do talk to other families about your child going to their home or riding in their car, you want to make sure you find out if any guns they have are stored safely — meaning they are secured in a safe and unloaded, Crifasi said.
   
      And that is not just in the home, Thomas added. 
   
      Some people store guns in their cars. A locked glove compartment is not secure enough to consider it out of harm’s way, according to Thomas. 
   
      Instead, she would hope to hear that the gun is in a car safe with a code or fingerprint lock, Thomas said. 
   
      Those safety measures are crucial because kids are curious, Crifasi said. 
   
      Too many times, Thomas has collected stories of one kid inviting over a classmate to come check out a parent’s gun and one or both children are injured, she said.
   
      And though many parents think that their child doesn’t know where they keep their gun, data from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions has shown most kids know where one is kept and can get to it within five minutes, Crifasi said. 
   
      The good news is most people want to keep kids safe when guns are in the home, and most people will be up-front about their firearms and how they are stored, Thomas said. 
   
      And it can start as simply as a text.
   
      When her daughter is going to meet with a new friend, Thomas said she likes to lay out all the safety information for that family. She mentions how many dogs they have, that there’s an alarm on the pool, that guns are stored unloaded in a safe separate from ammunition, and that alcohol is kept locked up.
   
      Then she asks if she should be aware of any other safety concerns.
   
      “I just throw it in there,” she said. And usually, the other parents respond right back to her with similar information.
   
      And although such a conversation may feel taboo, it isn’t so different than ones families are already having with one another every day, Crifasi added.
   
      “If your kid has a peanut allergy, you’re going to have zero issue saying, ‘Hey, when my kid comes over, please don’t give them any peanuts,’ ” she said.
   
      The Be SMART campaign offers resources on how to start those conversations.
   
      No matter how awkward the conversation, kids’ safety should always be the priority, said Lee, who is also a pediatric physician in emergency medicine and researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital.
   
      “If it’s in a general conversation about safety … framing it in that way hopefully will provide some context where it makes more sense to have these discussions with friends or family members.”
   
      When Thomas found out the mother of her daughter’s friend had a gun stowed under the car seat, a difficult conversation began. 
   
      Thomas decided to drive her daughter over to the house and asked if the parents could make a safety plan together for the next time her daughter rode with her friend. 
   
      “I’m pretty honest about it, I say, ‘In order for my child to come to your house, do you have a way you can secure those firearms that would be unloaded and locked in a safe?’ ” 
   
      Often, the other family will make arrangements to change the location of the firearms while her daughter is over. If not, Thomas said she will just offer to have the kids at her house or to meet somewhere else, such as a park or horseback riding barn.
   
      And if it’s just not comfortable, families should feel empowered not to send their children over, she added. 
   
      Now, it’s a normal conversation for Thomas’ family to have with others. And although she talks to her children about gun safety, too, Thomas said she sees it as ultimately the adults’ responsibility to keep guns away from kids. That means getting used to talking about it with friends and extended family. 
   
      “If we can save just one child’s life by having this conversation, then we’ve done our job as humans,” she said.

      Grab your favorite red shirt; it’s time to celebrate the Lunar New Year, also known as Spring Festival.
   
      Saying goodbye to the Tiger, we enter the Year of the Rabbit on January 22, 2023. 
   
      Millions of families worldwide are preparing celebrations for one of the year’s biggest festivals. 
   
      If you’re a Lunar New Year newbie, here’s a quick guide to the most common traditions and superstitions associated with the occasion.
   
      There are countless folktales attached to Lunar New Year, but the myth of “Nian” stands out as the most iconic and fun.
   
      Legend has it Nian was a ferocious underwater beast with sharp teeth and horns. Every Lunar New Year’s Eve, it crawled onto the land and attacked a nearby village.
   
      On one such occasion, as the villagers rushed into hiding, a mysterious old man showed up and insisted on staying in the village despite being warned of impending doom.
   
      To the villagers’ surprise, the old man and the village survived utterly unscathed.
   
      The man claimed to have scared Nian away by hanging red banners on the door, lighting firecrackers and wearing red clothes.
   
      This is how wearing the fiery color – right down to undergarments – along with hanging red banners with auspicious phrases and lighting firecrackers or fireworks became Lunar New Year traditions, all of which are still followed today. 
 
      Fun aside, Lunar New Year can actually be a lot of work.
   
      Festivities often last for 15 days – or even more – with different tasks and activities taking place over that period.
   
      It all begins about a week ahead of the new year.
   
      Before we get started, a quick note: while there are different ways to say “Happy new year!” depending on where you are, we’re sticking with Mandarin and Cantonese in this story. We have included the romanized versions of both languages in our descriptions of the various traditions.
   
      The week before Lunar New Year, festive cakes and puddings are made on the 24th day of the last lunar month.
   
      The word for cakes and puddings is “gao” in Mandarin or “gou” in Cantonese, which sounds the same as the word for “tall.” 
   
      As a result, eating them is believed to lead to improvements and growth in the coming year. (If you haven’t prepared your own “gou” yet, here’s an easy recipe for turnip cake, a beloved Lunar New Year dish.)
   
      But no Lunar New Year preparation would be complete without hanging red banners bearing auspicious phrases and idioms (called fai chun in Cantonese, or chunlian, in Mandarin) at home – beginning with one’s front door.
   
      A big cleanup is done in homes on the 28th day of the last lunar month, which fell on January 19 this year. 
   
      The aim is to rid your home of any bad luck that’s accumulated over the past year.Plenty of other rules and superstitions are attached to the Lunar New Year. 
   
      For instance, don’t wash or cut your hair on the first day of the new year. 
   
      Why? The Chinese character for hair is the first character in the word for prosper. Therefore washing or cutting it off is seen as washing your fortune away.
   
      You’ll also want to avoid purchasing footwear for the entire lunar month, as the term for shoes (haai) sounds like losing and sighing in Cantonese.
   
      Do, however, wear red. As noted above, it’s associated with luck and prosperity. (Read more Lunar New Year dos and don’ts here.) 
   
      A big family reunion dinner is usually held on Lunar New Year’s Eve, which falls on January 21 this year.
   
      The menu is carefully chosen to include dishes associated with luck, including fish (the Chinese word for it sounds like the word for “surplus”), puddings (symbolizes advancement) and foods that look like gold ingots (like dumplings).
   
      In China, the foods served at these classic dinners vary from north to south. For instance, northern Chinese tend to have dumplings and noodles, whereas southern Chinese can’t live without steamed rice.
   
      But no matter which dishes you prefer, Lunar New Year foods are a feast of wordplay.
 
      The first few days of the Lunar New Year, especially the first two days, are often a test of one’s stamina, appetite and social skills, as many people have to travel and visit immediate family, other relatives and friends.
   
      Bags are stocked with presents and fruits for each of the elders’ and friends’ homes visited, who will shower the visitor with gifts and snacks in return after exchanging conversations over Lunar New Year treats.
   
      Married people also have to give out red packets to those who haven’t yet tied the knot – both children and unmarried juniors.
   
      It’s believed these red envelopes could protect children from evil spirits called xie sui. The packets are known as yasui qian/Ngaat seoi cin and intended to ward off those spirits.
   
      Day three of the Lunar New Year (which falls on January 24 this year) is named “chi kou/cek hau,” or red mouth. It’s believed that arguments are more likely to happen on this day, so people will visit temples and avoid social interactions.
   
      Every year, certain Chinese zodiac signs clash with the stars negatively. A temple visit is a good way to resolve those conflicts and bring peace in the coming months.
   
      The seventh day (January 28) of the Lunar New Year is said to be the day when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it’s called renri/jan jat (the people’s birthday).
   
      Different communities in Asia will serve various birthday foods on that day. 
   
      For instance, people in Malaysia enjoy yeesang, or a “Prosperity Toss” of raw fish and shredded vegetables, whereas Cantonese people will eat sweet rice balls.
   
      The highlight of the whole Spring Festival happens on the 15th and final day (February 5 in 2023). 
   
      In ancient Chinese society, it was the only day when young girls were allowed to go out to admire the lanterns and meet boys. As a result, it’s also been dubbed Chinese Valentine’s Day.
   
      Nowadays, cities worldwide still put on massive lantern displays and fairs on the festival’s final day.

      As has frequently been the case throughout his unparalleled career, James Cameron made film history again this weekend.
   
      His long-awaited sequel “Avatar: The Way of Water” has now made over $2 billion in worldwide grosses, as reported by Deadline.
   
      That grand total is after the film’s box office take from this weekend, the sixth consecutive weekend the film has occupied the No. 1 spot since its release in December.
   
      CNN has reached out to “Avatar: The Way of Water” producing studio Disney for comment on the film’s latest financial achievement.
   
      “Avatar: The Way of Water” is the sequel to Cameron’s 2009 extraterrestrial epic “Avatar,” which remains at the top of the list of biggest-selling films of all time, according to Box Office Mojo.
   
      Another of Cameron’s films is also in the $2 billion club – 1997’s “Titanic.” Only three other films are part of that club – 2015’s “Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,” “Avengers: Infinity War” from 2018, and “Avengers: Endgame” from one year later.
   
      Cameron is therefore the only director who can boast that three of his films are among the six to have made over $2 billion, as well as in top 6 bestselling movies of all time.
   
      The director is planning to release at least three other “Avatar” sequels going forward.

India has banned a BBC documentary critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s alleged role in deadly riots more than 20 years ago from being shown in the country, in a move critics decried as an assault on press freedom. 
   
      A senior adviser for the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said directions to block the documentary were issued using “emergency powers” available to the government under India’s information and technology rules. 
   
      “Videos sharing @BBCWorld hostile propaganda and anti-India garbage, disguised as ‘documentary’, on @YouTube and tweets sharing links to the BBC documentary have been blocked under India’s sovereign laws and rules,” senior adviser Kanchan Gupta wrote on Twitter Saturday, adding both YouTube and Twitter have complied with the order. 
   
      CNN has contacted Twitter and YouTube for comment but is yet to hear back. 
   
      The two-part documentary “India: The Modi Question,” criticizes Modi, who was the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat in 2002 when riots broke out between the state’s majority Hindus and minority Muslims. 
   
      Violence erupted after the bombing of a train killed dozens of Hindus and was blamed on Muslims. In retaliation, Hindu mobs set fire to Muslim-owned homes and stores. More than 1,000 people – mostly Muslims – were killed, according to government figures. 
   
      Modi and his ruling ruling Bharatiya Janata Party rose to power in India in 2014, riding on a wave of Hindu nationalism in the country of 1.3 billion, where nearly 80% of the population follow the faith.
   
      He has previously denied accusations that he failed to stop the violence in 2002 and a special investigation team appointed by India’s Supreme Court in 2012 found no evidence to suggest he was to blame.
   
      India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Arindam Bagchi has called the documentary “a propaganda piece designed to push a particular discredited narrative.” 
   
      Speaking to reporters at a news conference Thursday, Bagchi said: “It makes us wonder about the purpose of this exercise and the agenda behind it and frankly we do not wish to dignify such efforts.”
   
      In response, the BBC said in a statement shared on social media that the documentary was “rigorously researched according to the highest editorial standards.” 
   
      The film took into account, “a wide range of voices, witnesses and experts… including responses from people in the BJP),” the statement said.  
   
      The Indian government had declined to reply when contacted by the BBC, the statement added. 
   
      CNN has reached out to the BBC for further comment but is yet to hear back. 
   
      The banning of the documentary has led to rancor among many in India, with Modi supporters rallying to his defense and opposition politicians criticizing the move
   
      BJP spokesman R. P. Singh said he welcomed the ban.
   
      “Keeping in mind 2024 elections, an eco-system is being built to tarnish the image of PM Narendra Modi ji,” he said in a statement on Twitter.  
   
      But opposition lawmaker Mahua Moitra said the government’s “raging censorship actions are unacceptable.” 
   
      “What BBC show proves or disproves is up to viewers to decide,” he said.
   
      The documentary explores an unpublished British government report obtained by the BBC, which the British public broadcaster said came in the form of a diplomatic cable. 
   
      The report, according to the BBC, reveals the violence which showed the events had “all the hallmarks of an ethnic cleansing,” claiming there was “widespread and systematic rape of Muslim women.” 
   
      The BBC said Jack Straw, who was British foreign secretary in 2002 and features in the documentary, claims that Modi had “played a pre-active part in pulling back the police and in tacitly encouraging the Hindu extremists.” 
   
      The first part of the documentary aired on the BBC on January 17, with part two due to air Tuesday.

That's why you still have to negotiate,"Now that more and more states are requiring companies to advertise salary ranges for open roles, you may assume the range is the range and you can't negotiate for more.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/28/success/negotiating-salary-pay-transparency-laws/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230127090739-02-job-interview-negotiation-stock.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-01-28T11:03:26Z,"
      Now that more and more states are requiring companies to advertise salary ranges for open roles, you may assume the range is the range and you can’t negotiate for more.
   
      Not true.
   
      While the new pay transparency laws mean you’ll have more information about what an employer is willing to pay, the ranges advertised likely won’t give you an accurate picture of what you might be paid for the actual role you’re applying for. So unless you do your own research, ask questions and then negotiate, you might shortchange yourself.
   
      “I’ve seen people deterred from negotiating because they think [the advertised pay range] is set in stone. We haven’t found that to be the case,” said Brandon Bramley, founder of The Salary Negotiator, which provides one-on-one consultation for people seeking to improve their pay packages and online courses in salary negotiation.
   
      Here are three reasons why a published salary range is hardly the whole story:
   
1. The range may not be the “full” range: Some employers only publish ranges between, say, the 25th and 75th percentiles of what they pay for a given position, said Lulu Seikaly, a senior attorney and pay transparency expert at Payscale. “A lot of organizations won’t post the entire range. It just has to be a good faith estimate.” 
   
      What’s more, Seikaly added, even if an employer publishes the full range for a job, employers are legally allowed to pay more to the right candidate.
   
      “There’s always flexibility to offer more than the top of the range,” she said.
   
2. The published range may be very wide: It’s not hard to find advertised salary ranges so wide you could drive a truck through them. Think yawning gaps of $100,000 or more between the minimum and the maximum.
   
      Some employers may do so because they’re using one posting to attract applicants for a few roles under the same general function — such as a software engineer. But each role is suitable to people at different levels of experience (such as a junior engineer, a mid-level engineer or a senior one), Seikaly noted.
   
      Similarly, an employer may publish the same wide range for each of several jobs with different responsibilities.  
   
      And sometimes, it’s not clear what an employer is thinking. Companies are in the trial-and-error stage of compliance since pay transparency laws are quite new and vary from place to place. The oldest one on the books, in Colorado, has only been in place for two years. Pay transparency laws in California and the state of Washington went into effect on January 1. And employers in New York City only started advertising pay three months ago, while employers in the rest of New York State won’t have to do so until September.
   
      When a range is laughably broad — Seikaly cited one posting that included a range of $90,000 to $900,000 — she believes the company is making “a very big branding mistake” because it appears as if they are not offering a good faith estimate and potential applicants might well be wary. “It’s a big red flag that they don’t value employees,” she said. 
   
3. The range typically reflects base salary only: There is a lot more to your compensation than your regular paycheck.
   
      The published range for an open role usually just reflects your base pay, not bonuses, equity and annual increases.
   
      And all those parts are often negotiable for the candidate a company wants most, even if a hiring manager or recruiter asserts that they’re not, Bramley said.
   
      What’s more, there are other negotiable parts of compensation that can augment your pay package, such as tuition reimbursement, a home office stipend and additional paid time off.
   
      Don’t take advertised ranges as gospel. Instead:
   
Do your own compensation research: Bramley recommends getting pay averages from three pay data aggregators such as Payscale and Comparably.
   
      That way you’ll be able to gauge whether the employer’s published range is within reason for the role you’re seeking. 
   
Get more information on the employer’s published range: If you’re considering applying for a job with a wide pay range, ask the recruiter what specific role the employer wants to slot you into and what the specific pay band is for that role. Then ask what skills and experience justify their offering a candidate pay at the top of the range.
   
      Some companies may most typically offer to pay candidates at the midpoint of the range unless the candidate is more junior or senior, said talent hiring executive Rachel Levine.
   
      An employer may choose to pay a candidate above the top of the advertised range if someone brings additional value or an exceptional skillset to the role than what current employees in that role have, Levine said.
   
Avoid sharing your pay expectations prematurely: Many states and localities ban organizations from asking job applicants what they’re currently making. So instead recruiters early on will ask you what your pay expectations are.
   
      “You get a lot of pressure to share,” Bramley said. The risk is you will offer a number below what an employer is actually willing to pay the right candidate, thereby limiting what you might get in the end. 
   
      “Flip the script when asked about your salary expectations,” Bramley suggested. “Ask what range they had in the mind for those who are best qualified.” Or, he added, you might say, “To be honest, my expectation may be near the top [of the advertised range]. But it’s hard to say right now because I want to learn more about the company, the role and its compensation structure.” 
   
It pays to ask for more: Once you have an offer in hand, you will be in the strongest position to negotiate for more because you know they want you, and most of the time you can secure something extra, Bramley said. But even if you can’t, he has never seen an offer rescinded because someone tried. “The worst case is they say ‘No’,” Bramley said.

      Those with an especially stubborn ex can pay for a $150 upgrade, which includes a personalized video message to the recipient showing their cockroach, rodent or vegetable being devoured by an animal.
   
      The annual event is a hit, Cyle Perez, the zoo’s director of public relations, told CNN. Last year, they received more than 8,000 donations from all 50 states and over 30 different countries.
   
      “Right now, we are on track to break last years record, with ‘Zach,’ ‘Ray’ and ‘Adam’ being the most submitted ex-names so far,” Perez said.
   
      To participate, you’ll need to submit your exes name online before Valentine’s Day.

      Hindenburg said it has taken a short position in companies in the Adani Group “through U.S.-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments.” Short sellers aim to make money by betting that the stock price of the companies they target will fall.
   
      Adani’s business empire contains seven listed companies — in sectors ranging from ports to power stations — and shares in most of them fell by between 3% and more than 8% on Wednesday.
   
      The plunge had an immediate impact on the billionaire’s net worth. According to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, Adani lost nearly $6 billion on Wednesday. He is currently worth $113 billion. Indian markets are closed Thursday.
   
      In its investigation, which Hindenburg said took two years to compile, the research firm questioned the “sky-high valuations” of Adani firms and said their “substantial debt” puts the entire group “on a precarious financial footing.”
   
      The research firm concluded its report with 88 questions for the Adani Group. These range from asking for details on Adani’s offshore entities, to why it has “such a convoluted, interlinked corporate structure.”
   
      CNN has not verified the claims in the report, and India’s stock market regulator did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
   
      Shares of Adani’s companies have surged in the last few years, making him Asia’s richest man.
   
      In a statement released a few hours after Hindenburg published its report, the Adani Group’s chief financial officer Jugeshinder Singh said that Hindenburg did not make “any attempt to contact us or verify the factual matrix,” adding that the allegations made by the short seller are “stale, baseless and discredited.”
   
      The conglomerate has faced scrutiny from Indian authorities in the past. In 2021, shares in Adani’s companies tumbled after The Economic Times newspaper said that foreign funds that hold stakes worth billions of dollars were frozen by the country’s National Securities Depository. The Adani Group called that report “blatantly erroneous.”
   
      Nate Anderson, who founded Hindenburg Research, has made a name for himself in the past few years by targeting companies that he thinks are overvalued and have suspect financials. Anderson is best known for going after electric truck company Nikola in 2020, calling it an “intricate fraud,” and causing the firm’s stock to plunge sharply. In 2022, Nikola’s founder was convicted by a US jury of fraud in a case alleging he lied to investors about the company’s technology.
   
      But some have accused Hindenburg of trying to push stocks lower with its research reports in order to make a profit. 
   
      Its report on the Adani Group comes at a sensitive time. Later this week, Adani Enterprises, the conglomerate’s flagship company, is aiming to raise 200 billion rupees ($2.5 billion) by issuing new shares. 
   
      Singh said that the “timing of the report’s publication clearly betrays a brazen, mala fide intention to undermine the Adani Group’s reputation with the principal objective of damaging the upcoming follow-on public offering.”
   
      The conglomerate is also considering taking five new businesses to the stock market in the next two to five years.
   
      In another statement on Thursday, the Adani Group said it is “evaluating the relevant provisions under US and Indian laws for remedial and punitive action against Hindenburg Research.”
   
      It added that it is “deeply disturbed” by the impact Hindenburg’s report has had on the group, its shareholders and investors, and by the “unwanted anguish caused to Indian citizens.” 
   
      A college dropout and a self-made industrialist, Adani is the world’s fourth richest man, ahead of Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. He is also seen as a close ally of India’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi. 
   
      The 60-year-old tycoon founded the Adani group over 30 years ago. It now has established businesses in industries ranging from logistics to mining, and is aggressively growing in diverse sectors such as media, data centers, airports, and cement.
   
      But this is not the first time analysts have expressed fear that the rapid expansion of his business comes with a huge risk. Adani’s juggernaut has been fueled by a $30 billion borrowing binge, making his business one of the most indebted in the country. 
   
      Last year, CreditSights, a research firm owned by Fitch Group, published a report about Adani Group titled “Deeply Overleveraged” in which it expressed strong concerns about its debt-funded growth plans. 
   
      Adani Group responded to CreditSights with a 15-page report, saying that the “leverage ratios” of its companies “continue to be healthy and are in line with the industry benchmarks in the respective sectors” and that they “have consistently de-levered” in the last nine years.

      The clock is now ticking on the nation’s debt ceiling drama.
   
      President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are set to meet for the first time on Wednesday to discuss possible solutions to resolving the situation before it becomes a full-blown crisis later this year.
   
      The two sides remain far apart. House Republicans continue to demand that lifting the borrowing cap be accompanied by spending cuts. The White House has said it will not negotiate or offer concessions and has pushed McCarthy to show the president his budget.
   
      The US hit its debt ceiling last month, triggering the Treasury Department to start taking extraordinary measures to prevent a default. 
   
      While Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen doesn’t expect the US to default on its debt before early June, Congress has to get serious about negotiating a solution, which is not expected to be easy.
   
      Here’s what the situation is all about.
   
      Established by Congress, the debt ceiling is the maximum amount the federal government is able to borrow to finance obligations that lawmakers and presidents have already approved – since the government runs budget deficits and the revenue it collects is not sufficient. Increasing the cap does not authorize new spending commitments.
   
      The debt ceiling, which currently stands at $31.4 trillion, was created more than a century ago and has been modified more than 100 times since World War II. 
   
      Though it was originally designed to make it easier for the federal government to borrow, the limit has become a way for Congress to restrict the growth of borrowing – turning it into a political football in recent decades. 
   
      Still, fears of a default have prompted lawmakers to pass legislation to raise or suspend the ceiling every time, most recently in December 2021. 
   
      In letters to McCarthy in January, Yellen wrote that she expects the extraordinary measures to last until early June, though she noted there is “considerable uncertainty” around that forecast.
   
      Once these measures and cash on hand are exhausted, the debt ceiling crisis would start having very real impacts. 
   
      If the government is no longer able to borrow, it would not have enough money to pay all its bills in full and on time – including interest on the national debt. So it would likely have to temporarily delay payments or default on some of its commitments, potentially affecting Social Security payments, veterans’ benefits and federal employees’ salaries, among others.
   
      But no one knows exactly how Treasury would handle the situation since it has never happened.
   
      A default would also wreak havoc on the US economy and the global financial markets, as well as raise borrowing costs. Even the threat of one in 2011 caused the only credit rating downgrade in the nation’s history.
   
      These moves are mainly behind-the-scenes accounting maneuvers. Treasury secretaries are authorized by Congress to take several types of extraordinary measures to prevent a default, giving lawmakers more time to increase or suspend the limit. Secretaries in both Democratic and Republican administrations have taken such steps.
   
      This time, Yellen is selling existing investments and suspending reinvestments of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund. Also, she is suspending the reinvestment of a government securities fund of the Federal Employees Retirement System Thrift Savings Plan.
   
      These funds are invested in special-issue Treasury securities, which count against the debt limit. Yellen’s actions will reduce the amount of outstanding debt subject to the limit and temporarily provide the agency with additional capacity to continue financing the federal government’s operations.
   
      This “debt issuance suspension period” will last through June 5, she wrote in a letter to McCarthy in January.
   
      No retirees will be affected, and the funds will be made whole once the impasse ends.
   
      Recent contention in the House speaker election has raised concerns about whether McCarthy will be able to corral Republican hardliners – who see a potential default as a way to force the government to cut back spending – and negotiate a deal with Democrats, who oppose any reductions.
   
      For now, he is leaning in on using the debt ceiling crisis to reduce spending and balance the US budget. In January, McCarthy rejected Democratic calls for a clean debt ceiling increase without any conditions attached. 
   
      The White House has countered that it will not offer any concessions or negotiate on raising the debt ceiling. The president plans to remind McCarthy of his “Constitutional obligation to prevent a national default.”
   
      Meanwhile, House Republicans are preparing contingency plans that would tell the Treasury Department which payments to prioritize if lawmakers can’t agree to address the debt ceiling.
   
      While the two are often confused, a government shutdown happens when Congress doesn’t pass a federal funding bill, while a debt ceiling crisis would occur if lawmakers don’t approve legislation to lift the debt limit.
   
      Congress passed a $1.7 trillion federal spending bill in December, avoiding a government shutdown that could have caused nonessential operations to cease and could have left many federal employees without pay. The legislation will fund government operations until the end of the fiscal year on September 30.

      This dog is a “fire-breathing demon” – but the Niagara SPCA wants you to adopt him anyway.
   
      The Niagara SPCA, a nonprofit animal shelter in New York’s Niagara County, has attracted attention on social media for its eye-catching ad for Ralphie, a rescue dog looking for a new home.
   
      Most adoption ads focus on the good qualities about an animal – the traits that might make a potential family choose to give a dog or cat their forever home.
   
      But the Niagara SPCA chose a different technique for Ralphie.
   
      “We don’t actually have too many nice things to say so we’re just going to come out with it,” wrote the shelter in a Tuesday Facebook post.
   
      The SPCA explained that “at first glance, he’s an adorable highly sought after, young dog. People should be banging down our doors for him.”
   
      But, in reality, “Ralphie is a terror in a somewhat small package,” according to the shelter. “We’re sure you’re thinking: my ankles will be just fine. We’d caution- proceed at your own risk.”
   
      The shelter wrote that the canine has already been adopted twice.
   
      His first owners re-homed him after an unsuccessful training process. Then, “Two weeks into this new home and he was surrendered to us because ‘annoys our older dog,’” the shelter went on. “What they actually meant was: Ralphie is a fire-breathing demon and will eat our dog, but hey, he’s only 26lbs.”
   
      Ralphie is a “whole jerk –  not even half,” wrote the shelter. 
   
      “Everything belongs to him. If you dare test his ability to possess THE things, wrath will ensue,” they wrote. “If you show a moment of weakness, prepare to be exploited.
   
      “The ideal home for Ralphie is the Mother of Dragons, or an adult home free of other animals, with an owner who will lead him calmly and sternly – putting up with zero crap,” they added.
   
      But brave potential adopters won’t be alone in their quest to combat Ralphie’s fiery nature. According to the shelter, “Ralphie’s previous trainer will provide his new adopters with the training tools they believe he needs to be successful in a home.”
   
      The Niagara SPCA told CNN that Ralphie was still available for adoption as of Friday.

      In the largest DNA analysis of its kind, scientists have found evidence to suggest that historic plague pandemics, such as the Black Death, were not caused by newly evolved strains of bacteria but ones that could have emerged up to centuries before their outbreaks.
   
      The plague-causing bacterium Yersinia pestis is dated to have first emerged in humans about 5,000 years ago. Through animals and trade routes, Y. pestis spread globally over time on multiple occasions, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Communications Biology.
   
      It caused the first plague pandemic in the sixth to eighth centuries and the second one in the 14th to 19th centuries. The latter pandemic is thought to have started with the medieval Black Death outbreak, which is estimated to have killed more than half of Europe’s population. The bacterium also caused the third plague pandemic between the 19th and 20th centuries.
   
      By amassing 601 Y. pestis genome sequences, including modern and ancient strains, researchers from Canada and Australia were able to calculate the time when the bacterial strains likely emerged as a threat. They divided the different strains of the plague bacterium and analyzed each strain population individually.
   
      The strain responsible for the Black Death, which the study says is thought to have begun in 1346, was newly estimated to have diverged from an ancestral strain between 1214 and 1315 — up to 132 years earlier.
   
      The strain of Y. pestis associated with the first plague pandemic was previously recorded as first appearing during the Plague of Justinian, which began in 541. However, the researchers estimated that the strain was already present between 272 and 465 — up to almost 270 years before the outbreak.
   
      “It shows that each major plague pandemic has likely emerged many decades to centuries earlier than what the historical record suggests,” study coauthor and evolutionary geneticist Hendrik Poinar, director of McMaster University’s Ancient DNA Centre in Canada, told CNN via email Thursday.
   
      He added that the bacterium emerged, created small epidemics and then “for reasons we don’t quite understand,” such as famine or war, “it takes off.”
   
      The study authors estimated that individually assessed bacterial strains from the third plague pandemic diverged from an ancestral strain between 1806 and 1901, with highly localized plague cases beginning to appear in southern China between 1772 and 1880 and later diverging into various strains that spread globally out of Hong Kong between 1894 and 1901.
   
      The study also found evidence to support recent academic research suggesting that the third and second plague pandemics were not mutually exclusive events, but that the third was partly the continuation or tail end of the second. Despite the pandemics having their own diverse genetic lineages that evolved differently, the third descended directly from the 14th century strain that caused the second.
   
      Poinar called this finding significant because “it takes into account that most of the history of this bacterium has been a Eurocentric view, so while plague supposedly disappeared from Europe in the 18th (century), it continued to rage in the Ottoman Empire and throughout the Middle East and likely North Africa.”
   
      However, even with so many sequences of the plague bacterium, researchers were not able to determine the path of the global spread of the plague.
   
      A lot of the genetic samples come from Europe. For example, the emergence of the bacterium in Africa has led to 90% of all modern plague cases occurring on the continent, yet there are no ancient sequences from the region, which is represented by just 1.5% of all genome samples — making it difficult to date the appearance of Y. pestis in Africa.
   
      There is also far less surviving historical evidence from the second plague pandemic to help estimate its geographic origins compared with the third, with the earliest textual evidence of the pandemic in Europe coming from the Black Death in 1346, the study authors said. The researchers estimated that the second pandemic originated in Russia.
   
      A study published in the journal Nature in June used DNA analysis to find the plague bacterium in three individuals who are dated to have died in 1338 in what’s now Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia. It provided evidence that the Black Death came from a strain originating in the area near Lake Issyk-Kul in Kyrgyzstan in the early 14th century. 
   
      The latest study concluded that more ancient DNA will be needed to refine current estimates on the early events of the second pandemic.
   
      Via email, Poinar described the strain from Kyrgyzstan as “really fascinating” but said that it “still doesn’t sit at the root. So I would guess we’re still looking for something a good 20-50 years earlier.” 
   
      He and the other authors noted that the only way to estimate the evolution of the plague bacterium strains precisely “is with well dated sequences, such as those from skeletal remains at Lake Issyk-Kul.”

      Jay Leno says he broke multiple bones in a motorcycle accident months after suffering severe burns to his face after another mishap.
   
In an interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the former late-night talk show host said he was knocked off his bike on January 17 and suffered a broken collarbone, two broken ribs and two cracked kneecaps.
   
      “But I’m OK!” Leno said. “I’m OK, I’m working. I’m working this weekend.”
   
      The comedian, who has a standup residency in Vegas, explained that he had been testing out a 1940 Indian motorcycle when he noticed the smell of leaking gasoline.
   
      “So I turned down a side street and cut through a parking lot, and unbeknownst to me, some guy had a wire strung across the parking lot but with no flag hanging from it,” Leno said. “So, you know, I didn’t see it until it was too late. It just clothesline me and, boom, knocked me off the bike.”
   
      Leno said he didn’t initially go public about the accident due to all the publicity he had received following the November incident in which his face was burned while he was working underneath an antique 1907 car.
   
      “The fuel line was clogged so I was underneath it. It sounded clogged and I said, ‘Blow some air through the line,’ and so he did,” the avid car collector explained duirng an appearance on “Today” in December. “And suddenly, boom, I got a face full of gas. And then the pilot light jumped and my face caught on fire.”
   
      Upon his hospital discharge following that accident, Leno posed for a photo with some of the employees at Grossman Burn Center in Los Angeles where he was treated. 
   
      CNN has reached out to reps for Leno for additional comment about his motorcycle accident.

      Weight loss surgery reduces the risk of premature death, especially from such obesity-related conditions as cancer, diabetes and heart disease, according to a new 40-year study of nearly 22,000 people who had bariatric surgery in Utah. 
   
      Compared with those of similar weight, people who underwent one of four types of weight loss surgery were 16% less likely to die from any cause, the study found. The drop in deaths from diseases triggered by obesity, such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes, was even more dramatic.
   
      “Deaths from cardiovascular disease decreased by 29%, while deaths from various cancers decreased by 43%, which is pretty impressive,” said lead author Ted Adams, an adjunct associate professor in nutrition and integrative physiology at the University of Utah’s School of Medicine.
   
      “There was also a huge percentage drop — a 72% decline — in deaths related to diabetes in people who had surgery compared to those who did not,” he said. One significant downside: The study also found younger people who had the surgery were at higher risk for suicide.
   
      The study, published Wednesday in the journal Obesity, reinforces similar findings from earlier research, including a 10-year study in Sweden that found significant reductions in premature deaths, said Dr. Eduardo Grunvald, a professor of medicine and medical director of the weight management program at the University of California San Diego Health.
   
      The Swedish study also found a significant number of people were in remission from diabetes at both two years and 10 years after surgery.
   
      “This new research from Utah is more evidence that people who undergo these procedures have positive, beneficial long-term outcomes,” said Grunvald, who coauthored the American Gastroenterological Association’s new guidelines on obesity treatment.
   
      The association strongly recommends patients with obesity use recently approved weight loss medications or surgery paired with lifestyle changes.
   
      “And the key for patients is to know that changing your diet becomes more natural, more easy to do after you have bariatric surgery or take the new weight loss medications,” said Grunvald, who was not involved in the Utah study.
   
      “While we don’t yet fully understand why, these interventions actually change the chemistry in your brain, making it much easier to change your diet afterwards.”
   
      Despite the benefits though, only 2% of patients who are eligible for bariatric surgery ever get it, often due to the stigma about obesity, said Dr. Caroline Apovian, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and codirector of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Apovian was the lead author for the Endocrine Society’s clinical practice guidelines for the pharmacological management of obesity.
   
      Insurance carriers typically cover the cost of surgery for people over 18 with a body mass index of 40 or higher, or a BMI of 35 if the patient also has a related condition such as diabetes or high blood pressure, she said.
   
      “I see patients with a BMI of 50, and invariably I will say, ‘You’re a candidate for everything — medication, diet, exercise and surgery.’ And many tell me, ‘Don’t talk to me about surgery. I don’t want it.’ They don’t want a surgical solution to what society has told them is a failure of willpower,” she said. 
   
      “We don’t torture people who have heart disease: ‘Oh, it’s because you ate all that fast food.’ We don’t torture people with diabetes: ‘Oh, it’s because you ate all that cake.’ We tell them they have a disease, and we treat it. Obesity is a disease, too, yet we torture people with obesity by telling them it’s their fault.”
   
      Most of the people who choose bariatric surgery — around 80% — are women, Adams said. One of the strengths of the new study, he said, was the inclusion of men who had undergone the procedure. 
   
      “For all-causes of death, the mortality was reduced by 14% for females and by 21% for males,” Adams said. In addition, deaths from related causes, such as heart attack, cancer and diabetes, was 24% lower for females and 22% lower for males who underwent surgery compared with those who did not, he said.
   
      Four types of surgery performed between 1982 and 2018 were examined in the study: gastric bypass, gastric banding, gastric sleeve and duodenal switch. 
   
      Gastric bypass, developed in the late 1960s, creates a small pouch near the top of the stomach. A part of the small intestine is brought up and attached to that point, bypassing most of the stomach and the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. 
   
      In gastric banding, an elastic band that can be tightened or loosened is placed around the top portion of the stomach, thus restricting the volume of food entering the stomach cavity. Because gastric banding is not as successful in creating long-term weight loss, the procedure “is not as popular today,” Adams said.
   
      “The gastric sleeve is a procedure where essentially about two-thirds of the stomach is removed laparoscopically,” he said. “It takes less time to perform, and food still passes through the much-smaller stomach. It’s become a very popular option.”
   
      The duodenal switch is typically reserved for patients who have a high BMI, Adams added. It’s a complicated procedure that combines a sleeve gastrectomy with an intestinal bypass, and is effective for type 2 diabetes, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
 
      One alarming finding of the new study was a 2.4% increase in deaths by suicide, primarily among people who had bariatric surgery between the ages of 18 and 34. 
   
      “That’s because they are told that life is going to be great after surgery or medication,” said Joann Hendelman, clinical director of the National Alliance for Eating Disorders, a nonprofit advocacy group.
   
      “All you have to do is lose weight, and people are going to want to hang out with you, people will want to be your friend, and your anxiety and depression are going to be gone,” she said. “But that’s not reality.”
   
      In addition, there are postoperative risks and side effects associated with bariatric surgery, such as nausea, vomiting, alcoholism, a potential failure to lose weight or even weight gain, said Susan Vibbert, an advocate at Project HEAL, which provides help for people struggling with eating disorders.
   
      “How are we defining health in these scenarios? And is there another intervention — a weight neutral intervention?” Vibbert asked. 
   
      Past research has also shown an association between suicide risk and bariatric surgery, Grunvald said, but studies on the topic are not always able to determine a patient’s mental history.
   
      “Did the person opt for surgery because they had some unrealistic expectations or underlying psychological disorders that were not resolved after the surgery? Or is this a direct effect somehow of bariatric surgery? We can’t answer that for sure,” he said.
   
      Intensive presurgery counseling is typically required for all who undergo the procedure, but it may not be enough, Apovian said. She lost her first bariatric surgery patient to suicide.
   
      “She was older, in her 40s. She had surgery and lost 150 pounds. And then she put herself in front of a bus and died because she had underlying bipolar disorder she had been self-medicating with food,” Apovian said. “We as a society use a lot of food to hide trauma. What we need in this country is more psychological counseling for everybody, not just for people who undergo bariatric surgery.”
   
      Managing weight is a unique process for each person, a mixture of genetics, culture, environment, social stigma and personal health, experts say. There is no one solution for all.
   
      “First, we as a society must consider obesity as a disease, as a biological problem, not as a moral failing,” Grunvald said. “That’s my first piece of advice.

      Five Russian men who fled the country after Moscow’s military mobilization order last September have been stranded at South Korea’s Incheon International Airport for months after authorities refused to accept them. 
   
      Three of the men had arrived in October, with the remaining two in November, said their lawyer Lee Jong-chan. 
   
      Lee said that their applications for refugee status were denied by the South Korean Justice Ministry – leaving them stranded at the departure area for months while awaiting a ruling on their appeal. “They are provided with one meal a day, which is lunch,” Lee told CNN. “But for the rest of the day they live off bread and drinks.” 
   
      The men are able to shower but have to wash their clothes by hand and are unable to leave the departure and duty-free areas, he added. 
   
      “They have limited access to medical care (and) no support for their mental health which is important considering their precarious situation,” he said. 
   
      The “partial mobilization” of Russian citizens to fight in the country’s war on Ukraine generated angry protests and prompted a mass exodus when it was announced last September. Many scrambled across land border crossings or bought air tickets out of the country. 
   
      Collective data showed that more than 200,000 people fled Russia for Georgia, Kazakhstan and the European Union in the first week after mobilizations were announced.
   
      “I don’t support what’s going on so I just decided that I had to leave right away,” one man who left for Belarus previously told CNN. “It feels bad because a lot of my friends, a lot of people don’t support the war and they feel threatened by what is going on, and there is no democratic way to really stop this, to even declare your protest,” the man had said.
   
      Men up to the age of 60 with no criminal record are eligible for military conscription. Prior military experience is not always required.
   
      Soldiers who refuse to fight and return to the front line are reportedly held in basements in occupied Ukrainian territory and face charges of desertion, according to their families. 
   
      Only those convicted of sex crimes against minors, treason, spying or terrorism are exempted from conscription. 
   
      South Korea’s Ministry of Justice has dismissed the men’s applications as “not being worthy of evaluation” – on the grounds that refusal of conscription was not a reason for refugee recognition, according to their lawyer Lee.
   
      Their refusal to serve in the Russian military “should be recognized as a political reason” considering that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was “condemned by international law,” Lee said. 
   
      Rights groups have called on the South Korean government to accept the men as refugees. 
   
      “Those who apply for refugee status upon escaping political and religious persecution from their home countries have rights to protection under international law,” read a statement from a South Korean rights advocacy group. It was highly likely that the men would be “detained or forcibly drafted” if they returned home, the group added. 
   
      “They are political refugees who face persecution.” 
   
      The men have appealed the decision and three of them are set to face their first ruling on January 31 – during which a court will decide if their case is “worthy of evaluation,” Lee their lawyer said.
   
      If the court rules in their favor, the Justice Ministry will then have to review the men’s applications for refugee status. 
   
      Military conscription is a sensitive issue in South Korea, where military service is mandatory for all able bodied men between the ages of 18 and 35. 
   
      Not even the country’s athletes or K-pop superstars are exempted from military service. Conscientious objection, which was illegal for decades, was not allowed until a landmark ruling in 2018. However, religious groups have continued to voice concerns about forms of “alternative service” that involve working in correctional facilities for three years.

      Three people have died and at least one person is missing as a result of torrential rain that has caused major flooding and numerous evacuations in New Zealand, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said Saturday.
   
      “The loss of life underscores just the sheer scale of this weather event and how quickly it turned tragic,” Hipkins said in a press briefing after meeting with emergency services and surveying the damage in Auckland. “It’s clear that it’s going to be a big cleanup job.” 
   
      He had traveled to Whenuapai, north of Auckland, to visit affected communities, CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand reported Saturday. 
   
      “This is an unprecedented event,” Hipkins, who was only sworn into office this week, wrote on Twitter. “We will get as much support to you as we can.” 
   
      Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, has been badly hit by heavy rain and thunderstorms. Friday was the city’s wettest day on record, with an estimated 240mm of rainfall – equal to an entire summer’s worth of rain. 
   
      Airport authorities said that terminals and roads were affected by widespread flooding. Photos and videos shared on Twitter showed travelers wading through water in terminals. Thousands had also camped out in the terminals overnight due to the flooding, officials said.
   
      Search and rescue teams said they had responded to more than 400 emergency calls made about the weather. 
   
      The airport reopened for domestic flights on Saturday at 12 p.m. local time and the domestic terminal “is operating as normal,” the airport said in an update on social media.
   
      However, it added that no international flights will be operated at Auckland’s airport on Saturday, with no international arrivals until 7 a.m. local time on Sunday.
   
      “Auckland Airport has been assessing the damage to our international terminal and unfortunately determined that no international flights can operate today,” the airport said on Twitter. 
   
      “We know this is extremely frustrating but the safety of passengers is our top priority,” it said. 
   
      The rain has since eased. But heavy rain, though not as extreme, is still expected in the coming days, meteorologists said. 
   
      Hipkins reiterated the governement’s focus on “making sure we support Aucklanders,” while speaking to press alongside Auckland’s mayor and disaster management officials on Saturday.
   
      “In the aftermath, we will have plenty of time to evaluate the response … but for now our focus is on making sure we support Aucklanders through this,” the prime minister said amid questions of whether the government responded quick enough.
   
      Hipkins said that he had seen the impact the rains have had on communities and that the central government will provide as much support as it can. 
   
      He said the government has already made available an initial $100,000 NZD ($64,900 USD) for impacted communities and more funding will be available.
   
      The prime minister also acknowledged the way people have come together “to take care of each other” and reiterated warnings that more bad weather is on the way.
   
      A number of events in the city, including Elton John concerts, have been canceled.
   
      The singer said he was “absolutely heartbroken” that Friday’s concert couldn’t go ahead. 
   
      “I was at the venue and determined to play as the weather reports we received in advance weren’t fully conclusive,” he wrote in a post on Instagram.
   
      Concert promoter Frontier Touring confirmed on Twitter that Saturday’s show has also been canceled.

      The conduct of the Memphis police officers who were charged with fatally beating Tyre Nichols is revolting in its brutality and disheartening in revealing just how little the needle of police reform has moved in decades. 
   
      On January 7, officers pulled Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, from his car during a traffic stop and forced him to the ground, shouting threats before spraying him in the face with pepper spray. Questions remain as to why Nichols was stopped, with the Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis saying they have not been able to confirm claims that he had been driving recklessly. 
   
      Nichols, who struggled to his feet and ran off, was found minutes later. Police body camera and surveillance footage released Friday showed the officers striking Nichols with a baton, kicking him in the head and repeatedly punching him before propping him against a police car. 
   
      The officers then milled around, with no one rendering aid in the critical minutes following the beating. It took an ambulance more than 20 minutes to arrive on the scene, and Nichols, who suffered “extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating,” according to preliminary results of an autopsy commissioned by attorneys for his family, died three days later.  
   
      Based on my 28 years of experience as a former police officer and captain, it was clear to me that the officers lacked supervision, showed little professional maturity and escalated a situation into what would eventually become a deadly encounter through gross negligence and a complete disregard for human life. 
   
      The damage is even more traumatic for the Black community, given that the five officers who were charged with murder, are all Black. Members of the Black community often expect Black officers to be their vanguard. 
   
      To see Black officers embracing brutality and aligning themselves with a police subculture that calls for loyalty to even the most heinous of police behaviors — such as beating subjects who run from the police —  is beyond devastating, especially since modern day policing in this country can be traced back to slave patrols, and abuses within the criminal justice system continue to result in the over-policing and death of Black people.  
   
      After Nichols’ death, the union representing the officers issued a statement on Facebook that read, “The Memphis Police Association would, again, like to extend condolences to the family of Mr. Tyre Nichols. The Memphis Police Association is committed to the administration of justice and NEVER condones the mistreatment of ANY citizen nor ANY abuse of power.” 
   
      The association’s current stance is unusual. It did not defend the arrested officers outright or say that they were just doing a difficult job that required them to make split-second decisions – responses we’ve come to expect from police unions that so often help shield officers accused of misconduct from accountability. 
   
      The public has noted the swift action taken against the five officers, all members of a specialized unit tasked with addressing crime, known as Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods (SCORPION). In less than two weeks, all five were fired. Criminal charges were filed and body worn camera video was released in three weeks. These actions were appropriate. As Ben Crump, the attorney representing Nichols’ family, said in a press conference on Friday, we now know that swift transparency and accountability is indeed possible in cases of death involving police officers, and the case in Memphis is a blueprint.
   
      Many have noted the police assault on Nichols is reminiscent of that on Rodney King, a Black man whose beating at the hands of Los Angeles police officers in 1991 was captured on video. But the beating of Nichols is actually much worse because it shows that after nearly 32 years, the needle of police reform has barely moved, and seemingly minor traffic violations continue to lead to the deaths of Black and other minority men and women in police encounters. 
   
      Efforts to push for police reform in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in 2020 have been largely replaced with calls to address the fear of rising crime, partially through hiring more police officers. Last year, President Joe Biden proposed funding for 100,000 new police officers as part of his Safer America Plan and the 2023 omnibus appropriations bill includes $324 million in funding to hire more police officers.
   
      However, I know from experience that crime prevention is achieved through trusting relationships between the police and the community it serves, rather than feeding a broken system more police officers. There can be no trust when there is over-policing of disadvantaged communities with suppression units such as the SCORPION unit, which were formed to protect communities – not terrorize them. (On Saturday, the Memphis Police Department announced it will permanently disband its SCORPION unit.)
   
      The federal policing bill that bears George Floyd’s name failed to pass in the Senate and efforts to end qualified immunity, a judicial doctrine that protects police officers from being held personally liable for violating a person’s rights, have not succeeded in Congress. 
   
States and local jurisdictions have tried to tackle police misconduct through new policies and legislation. Law enforcement has conducted training time and again and revised policy over and over, and yet we still have too many unnecessary deaths at the batons, feet, hands, fists, and guns of police. 
   
      Such deaths are preventable, but training or a patchwork of local policies will not be sufficient. Transformation will look like dedication to change through federal legislation that addresses the use of no-knock warrants, duty to intervene, use of excessive force, and other dangerous policing issues; the placement of strong political change-makers in office through voting and a commitment by the criminal “justice” system to hold corrupt police officers accountable for their actions through administrative and criminal charges. 
   
      Proof of success will come when we never again hear the plaintive cries of a Black man calling for his mother while being brutalized.

Fudge,Opinion: HUD Secretary on how to make fair housing a reality,"Even though the Fair Housing Act of 1968 directed the agency ""to administer our programs and activities in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing,"" that mission hasn't quite been accomplished yet, writes US Secretary of Housing and Urban Developmen…",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/19/opinions/fair-housing-combat-discrimination-fudge/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230113102633-03-us-housing-market.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-01-19T11:07:00Z,"
      Martin Luther King Jr. did not live to see the Fair Housing Act become law, but its passage was a consequential part of his legacy.
   
      The Chicago Freedom Movement, which King helped lead, directly confronted the racist policies that blocked Black families from obtaining desired housing in White neighborhoods, pushed hardworking Black people into sub-standard homes and slums and trapped them in seemingly never-ending cycles of poverty.
   
      The full realization of the Freedom Movement’s work, and the advocacy of countless others in the Civil Rights Movement, did not come until the Civil Rights Act of 1968 – better known as the Fair Housing Act – was signed into law just one week after King was assassinated. 
   
      “Now, with this bill, the voice of justice speaks again. It proclaims that fair housing for all – all human beings who live in this country – is now a part of the American way of life,” President Lyndon B. Johnson said at the time.  
   
      The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination because of a person’s race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), religion, disability and familial status. 
   
      Additionally, the Fair Housing Act directs the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to carry out one of our most important duties: to administer our programs and activities in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing.  
   
      The courts have long held that that directive requires HUD, and those who receive our funding, to take proactive and meaningful action to overcome patterns of segregation, to promote fair housing choice, eliminate disparities in housing-related opportunities and foster inclusive communities that are free from discrimination. 
   
      Yet for most of the Fair Housing Act’s history, HUD has failed to fully enforce this requirement. It finally took critical steps in that direction with the 2015 rule on Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, which established guideposts for state and local governments that receive HUD funding regarding fair housing. 
   
      However, that rule was only barely in effect until the summer of 2020, when the previous administration ended it. 
   
      All the while, ugly practices of discrimination in housing have persisted. Too often, people with disabilities are denied reasonable accommodation or forced to pay extra fees to rent housing. Hardworking families are blocked from purchasing homes because of the color of their skin. 
   
      And after decades of unequal treatment – often facilitated by federal funds – too many lack true housing choice and the ability to access opportunities that would allow them to succeed and thrive. 
   
      Under the leadership of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, HUD is taking bold action to realize the full promise of the Fair Housing Act and live up to King’s legacy. Soon, HUD will publish a “Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing,” that builds on the successes of the 2015 rule and proposes refinements to make it stronger, based on a deliberative and thoughtful engagement process.   
   
      The proposed rule would result in greater impact by charging local governments and other recipients of HUD funding to set ambitious goals to not only confront and reject housing discrimination in all forms but recognize and remedy enduring inequality. 
   
      It would give state and local leaders the tools and framework necessary to advance fair housing. The rule is intended to allow communities to leverage HUD funding with other federal, state and local resources to develop solutions that meet their own unique needs. 
   
      Most importantly, the proposed rule would give the community a seat at the table in our ongoing work to guarantee fair housing, while adding accountability mechanisms to ensure that recipients of HUD funding comply with their duty to affirmatively further fair housing.
   
      When finalized, this rule will be vitally important to our work to address ongoing segregation, disinvestment from communities of color and discrimination in housing markets. At its core, it will allow our country to create more places of opportunity where all residents can thrive. 
   
      To get there, HUD is seeking public input. We are confident that thoughtful and robust feedback will fortify our collective work to ensure our commitments to affirmatively furthering fair housing can be both realized and sustained.
   
      We know there is work to be done to root out discrimination in all forms and to remedy the lasting effects of the inequities our communities have endured for too long. Every day we are reminded of the many obstacles we still face on that front. 
   
      To quote King, “now is the time to make real the promise of democracy. Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity for all of God’s children.”
   
      I am confident this proposed rule brings us one step closer to making the promise of democracy real and affirmatively furthering fair housing for all.

      House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday officially denied seats on the House Intelligence Committee to Democratic Reps. Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff, the former chairman of the panel.
   
      The decision reflects the increasingly politicized nature of one of Congress’ most important national security committees and was swiftly met with outrage by the two California Democrats, both of whom played key roles in the impeachments of former President Donald Trump.
   
      “I cannot put partisan loyalty ahead of national security, and I cannot simply recognize years of service as the sole criteria for membership on this essential committee. Integrity matters more,” McCarthy wrote in a letter to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries that he posted on Twitter Tuesday night.
   
      McCarthy has cited a “new standard” from Democrats for why he would strip Schiff and Swalwell, both of California, of their committee assignments. The Democrat-led House in 2021 removed GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona from their committees for inflammatory rhetoric, including support for violence against Democratic members of Congress.
   
      In the letter, McCarthy added that “it is my assessment that the misuse of this panel during the 116th and 117th Congresses severely undermined its primary national security and oversight missions – ultimately leaving our nation less safe,” and that he wants the panel to be one of “genuine honesty and credibility that regains the trust of the American people.” 
   
      “It’s political vengeance,” Swalwell said following the decision on Tuesday. “It’s too bad because that committee has always been a bipartisan committee, and he’s taking one of the most precious pieces of glassware in the congressional cabinet and smashing it, and the damage is going to be irreparable.” 
   
      He added that “if a Democrat advocated for violence against another member of Congress, I would support getting rid of them.”
   
      Schiff told reporters that “if McCarthy thinks this is going to stop me from vigorously pushing back against his efforts to tear down these institutions, he’s going to find out just how wrong he is.”
   
      “I think this is a terrible move on his part and once again, showing McCarthy just catering to the most extreme elements of this conference,” he added.
   
      Schiff will sit on the Judiciary Committee, according to a Democratic aide, while Swalwell told CNN he will sit on the Judiciary and Homeland Security panels.
   
      Some House Republicans have criticized McCarthy’s move ejecting Democrats from the intelligence panel. GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana said in a statement that she opposes the push to remove the Democrats.
   
      “I appreciate these Republican members speaking out against what McCarthy is doing,” Schiff later told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360.”
   
      “I think it does show that there are Republicans who understand this is very ill considered. It’s just going to damage the institution, it’s not justified,” he added. “These efforts are not at all bipartisan. Indeed, the opposition to it is bipartisan.”
   
      The three Democrats whom McCarthy ousted or plan to oust stood in unity at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday.
   
      “The three of us have chosen to stick together because this isn’t about any individual committee assignments, and this is about an institution where the speaker of the House is using his power to go after his political opponents, and to pick them off the field,” Swalwell said. 
   
      They all seemed in agreement that the “destructive move” was especially hypocritical, given embattled Rep. George Santos has been seated on committees. Democrats and Republicans have called on Santos, a freshman Republican from New York, to resign following a series of false statements he has made including misrepresenting parts of his identity and his resume. 
   
      “This is a Republican speaker who is seating a human fraud, George Santos, on committees, a serial fabricator about every part of his existence. He’s perfectly comfortable with it,” Schiff said.
   
      McCarthy on Tuesday also announced the list of GOP members he is appointing to serve on the select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government, with Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan to serve as its chair.
   
      GOP Reps. Dan Bishop of North Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas, who were part of the initial holdouts against McCarthy in the speakership race, also gained spots on the panel. Democrats will have the opportunity to appoint members as well. 
   
      The speaker also announced appointments to the select subcommittee on the Coronavirus pandemic, with Greene among the members chosen. 
   
      McCarthy expanded both of the select committees, naming more people to the rosters than initially expected due to “overwhelming interest” from members, according to a GOP source familiar. House Republicans will have to put forward a floor resolution to formally amend the ratios, the source added, but doesn’t anticipate it will be an issue.

Lupus is a chronic inflammatory condition which causes the body to attack its own healthy cells and tissues. 
   
Gomez revealed she had lupus in 2015. Two years later, she shared that the condition led to her undergoing a kidney transplant, donated by her friend, actress Francia Raisa.

      If a person is said to be grounded, it means that they are sensible and stable – solid individuals who can be relied upon to give a careful and considered opinion. The very meaning of the term comes from the solidity and stability of the ground on which we walk. However, recent reports in the media have painted a different picture of what goes on beneath the ground – one in which the core of the Earth is doing some very surprising and unexpected things.
   
      A recent paper published in the journal Nature Geoscience describes a change in the motion of the Earth’s core – and with that news, headlines proliferated, some claiming that the Earth’s core has stopped rotating.
   
      But this interpretation is actually misleading. The Earth’s core is not literally stopping; however it is changing.
   
      The Earth is not a solid ball; it consists of several layers. There is the innermost core, which is a solid sphere about the same size as the planet Mars. Surrounding that is the outer core, which is liquid rock. The next layer is the mantle, which is sort of taffy-like in consistency. Finally there is the crust, which is the outermost layer– the place where we live.
   
      If the Earth were a solid ball, every layer would rotate in sync, spinning once per day.  However, because of the layered structure, it is possible for the core of the Earth to rotate at a slightly different rate from the surface and other layers. And, in the 1990s, researchers used geological data taken over the previous few decades to show that the core of the Earth was rotating slightly faster than the rest of the Earth. The difference is tiny – about 1° per year faster than the surface of the Earth.
   
      This more recent study found that the rotation of the core is slowing. It isn’t stopping, but is now rotating at the same speed of the Earth. Furthermore, it appears that the core might be slowing so that it will eventually rotate slightly slower than the Earth. This is scientifically interesting, but rather less dramatic than some of the headlines have suggested.
   
      Researchers have seen this periodic change in the speed of the rotation of the Earth’s core before and they still debate the rate at which it occurs, with some suggesting a 70 year cycle, while others suggest a much faster one.
   
      For geologists, this is fascinating stuff.  The radius of the Earth is just shy of 4,000 miles and the deepest well anyone has ever dug is a little over 7.5 miles deep. The crust under the Earth’s continents can be about 40 miles deep, although the crust under the oceans can be much thinner. Figuring out the structure of the Earth requires indirect methods, involving studying how fast the waves from earthquakes travel through the Earth, or studying the rich treasure trove of data of how the sound from nuclear blasts pass through the Earth. With a few exceptions, nuclear testing stopped in the mid-1990s.
   
      Breathy headlines aside, this recent study confirms earlier results showing that the inner core’s rotation changes over time and helps geologists trying to figure out the mechanism whereby those changes occur.  What geologists care about is the interplay between gravitational and magnetic forces within the Earth that speed up and slow down the core’s rotation.
   
      However, there is a much more important lesson to be drawn here, which is that scientists are able to make extremely precise measurements of what is going on under the surface of the Earth. This is a big deal – after all, it’s the only planet we have. What goes on under the Earth has huge potential consequences for humanity.
   
      Consider the supervolcano that is slumbering below Yellowstone National Park. Every half a million years or so (sometimes longer), Yellowstone transforms into a volcano that spews hundreds or thousands times of more ash into the atmosphere than the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens. While some have worried that perhaps the Yellowstone supervolcano is due for another eruption, recent studies have allayed the concern that the danger is imminent. However, given the magnitude of the damage such an eruption would occur, it is imperative that geologists continue to monitor what is going on.
   
      And there is much more going on under the Earth’s surface. The Earth’s magnetic field guides ships at sea and lost hikers to safety. It’s easy to believe that the familiar compass will always work, however geologists have shown that the Earth’s magnetic field isn’t constant. Indeed, every few hundred thousand years, the field flips, with magnetic south becoming north, and vice versa. 
   
      And, while a flip is probably not imminent, the location of magnetic north changes even on human time scales. In the early 1900s, it was located in northern Canada, however it has moved out into the Arctic Ocean and is now approaching Siberia.
   
      By understanding more about the inner workings of the Earth, scientists will be able to help humanity prepare for significant changes in the Earth’s magnetic field. If it happened, we’d have to change all instrumentation that relies on compasses to navigate.
   
      We have but one planet and what happens inside of it can affect all of us. It is imperative that geologists continue to study what’s going on inside our globe – and this recent measurement of changes in the rotation of the Earth’s core gives us some comfort that we are staying up to speed.
   
      And…come on and admit it… that’s pretty cool.

That could be dangerous,"As the Federal Reserve continues its inflation-fighting tightrope act, market moves suggest that investors may be feeling more at ease with the central bank's actions.

      As the Federal Reserve continues its inflation-fighting tightrope act, market moves suggest that investors may be feeling more at ease with the central bank’s actions. That’s not necessarily a good thing. 
   
What’s happening: The Fed is widely expected to reduce the pace at which it is hiking rates to a quarter of a percentage point in its upcoming meeting in February, following a similar deceleration in December when it hiked by half a point instead of three-quarters. 
   
      The Fed has eased last year’s historically high interest rate increases and recent data suggests that the chances of a “soft landing” for the US economy have improved. Price increases are also moderating: December brought the sixth consecutive monthly fall in consumer price index (CPI) inflation to 6.5%. 
   
      This all means that investors are beginning to worry less about the Fed. To put it simply: Wall Street has bigger fish to fry. 
   
      In the past few weeks, market reactions to speeches by Federal Reserve governors and new inflation data have gotten smaller while reactions to fourth-quarter corporate earnings announcements have gotten larger, according to Savita Subramanian, a quantitative strategist at Bank of America, in a recent analysis. 
   
      That’s a change from 2022 when the Fed and the market tended to move in unison.
 
      Investors have a serious fear of uncertainty, but they’re sleeping well ahead of next week’s Fed policy decision — they’re about 98% sure that the central bank will announce a quarter-point hike, according to the CME FedWatch tool. 
   
Not so fast: There are still plenty of reasons for the Fed to remain hawkish. Labor markets remain strong, with the unemployment rate dropping to a post-pandemic low of 3.5%, and wage growth also remains high. Policymakers also seem to expect that the robust labor market will persist for some time. 
   
      Even as inflation slows, a look under the hood of the latest report suggests that price increases may be higher and more persistent than the market hopes. Services inflation continues to run hot. Shelter inflation, a measure of housing costs and the CPI’s largest component, just marked its strongest annualized rate (7.5%) since the 1980s. 
   
      Investors are misreading the outlook for inflation, just as they did in July 2022, argues Gargi Chaudhuri, head of iShares Investment Strategy for the Americas at Blackrock. “We’ve seen this movie before,” she wrote in a recent note. 
   
      Fed funds futures now imply that the central bank will end its tightening streak by June and predict that it will ease interest rates by half a percentage point by the end of the year. But that outcome is at odds with the Fed’s own verbal guidance and with its summary of economic projections. 
   
      “We do not expect the Fed to ease this year, even as growth slows, making it likely that we will see a recession in the U.S. in the second half of 2023,” said Chaudhuri. 
   
      This could mean that the upcoming Fed meeting will generate a lot of market disappointment, said Christian Scherrmann, an economist at DWS Group. 
   
      The Fed flagged investors’ persistent belief in a pivot away from elevated rates as something that could hurt efforts to restore price stability. Officials have also pointed to the growing gap between its projections and market pricing as a problem.
   
What it means: “The Fed foresees a soft landing, with an increasing risk of a mild recession, enabling it to keep rates higher for longer,” said Scherrmann. “On the other side, markets are pricing in a more severe economic downturn, forcing the Fed to bring down rates quickly.”
   
      There appear to be two conflicting views on the table for how the economy will evolve; next week’s Fed meeting may help bring them together or tear them further apart.  
   
      Bed Bath & Beyond coupons never expire, but you still better use them quickly. That’s because the end could be near for the long-struggling retailer, report my colleagues Paul R. La Monica and Nathaniel Meyersohn. 
   
      Bed Bath & Beyond warned in a regulatory filing Thursday that it received a notice of default from its lender, JPMorgan Chase. Shares of the company plunged more than 20% on the news, to about $2.56 a share.
   
      The company said in its SEC filing Thursday that “at this time, the Company does not have sufficient resources to repay the amounts under the Credit Facilities and this will lead the Company to consider all strategic alternatives, including restructuring its debt under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.”
   
      Bed Bath & Beyond defaulted “on or around” January 13, according to the Securities & Exchange Commission filing. As a result, creditors are demanding immediate payment and Bed Bath & Beyond could be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization due to its financial woes.
   
      This week, the US Justice Department accused Google of running an illegal monopoly in its online advertising business and called for parts of it to be broken up, reports my colleague Brian Fung.
   
      Google said the Justice Department is “doubling down on a flawed argument” and that the latest suit “attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector.” 
   
      If successful, however, the blockbuster case could upend a business model that’s made Google the most powerful advertising company on the internet. It would be the most consequential antitrust victory against a tech giant since the US government took on Microsoft more than 20 years ago.
   
      But even though the lawsuit drives at the heart of Google’s revenue machine, it could take years to play out. In the meantime, two other thorny issues are poised to determine Google’s future on a potentially shorter timeframe: The rise of generative artificial intelligence and what appears to be an accelerating decline in Google’s online ad marketshare.
   
      Just days before the DOJ suit, Google announced plans to cut 12,000 employees amid a dramatic slowdown in its revenue growth, and as it works to refocus its efforts partly around AI.
   
      As Brian writes: “For the better part of 15 years, Google has seemed like an unstoppable force, powered by the strength of its online search engine and digital advertising business. But both now look increasingly vulnerable.” 
   
      Nothing lasts forever.

      A Norwegian study has found a “substantial” amount of metals and minerals ranging from copper to rare earths on the seabed of its extended continental shelf, authorities said on Friday in their first official estimates.
   
      These resources are in high demand for the role they play in the transition to a greener economy.
   
      The Nordic country, a major oil and gas exporter, is considering whether to open its offshore areas to deep-sea mining, a process that requires parliament’s approval and has sparked environmental concerns.
   
      “Of the metals found on the seabed in the study area, magnesium, niobium, cobalt and rare earth minerals are found on the European Commission’s list of critical minerals,” the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), which conducted the study, said in a statement.
   
      The resources estimate, covering remote areas in the Norwegian Sea and Greenland Sea, showed there were 38 million tonnes of copper, almost twice the volume mined globally each year, and 45 million tonnes of zinc accumulated in polymetallic sulphides.
   
      The sulphides, or “black smokers,” are found along the mid-ocean ridge, where magma from the Earth’s mantle reaches the sea floor, at depths of around 3,000 meters (9,842 feet).
   
      About 24 million tonnes of magnesium and 3.1 million tonnes of cobalt are estimated to be in manganese crusts grown on bedrock over millions of years, as well as 1.7 million tonnes of cerium, a rare earth element used in alloys.
   
      The manganese crusts are also estimated to contain other rare earth metals, such as neodymium, yttrium and dysprosium.
   
      “Costly, rare minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium are extremely important for magnets in wind turbines and the engines in electric vehicles,” the NPD said.
   
      Environmental groups have called on Norway to postpone its seabed mineral exploration until more studies are conducted to understand the organisms living on the seabed and the impact of mining on them.
   
      There is “a great lack of knowledge” of deep oceans, where new and undiscovered species are potentially to be found, Norway’s Institute of Marine Research said in a consultation letter.
   
      The International Seabed Authority, the UN-affiliated body that oversees the deep-sea mining sector, is expected to announce regulations for the nascent industry in July. Many scientists have warned that mining the deep sea could have huge and irreversible implications for the fragile ecosystem.
   
      The NPD said its estimates showed resources “in place,” and further studies were needed to establish how much of those could be recovered with acceptable environmental impact.
   
      The Norwegian find follows the announcement in January by Swedish mining company LKAB that it had found Europe’s largest deposit of rare earth oxides in the country’s far north. The market for rare earths is dominated by China, none are currently mined in Europe leaving it dependent on imports. 
   
      “This is good news, not only for LKAB, the region and the Swedish people, but also for Europe and the climate,” said Jan Moström, president and group CEO of LKAB, said in a statement.

      In December, a German court made headlines when it convicted a 97-year-old former Nazi concentration camp secretary for her role in the murder of over 10,000 people during the war. The decision to pursue a crime 77 years after the end of World War II is the latest in Germany’s assurance of its utmost commitment to atoning for the Holocaust.  
   
      Across the United States and Europe, the Holocaust is rapidly fading from memory, but Germany is trying to prove that it will never forget. In addition to prosecuting Nazis, the country has been a leader in ensuring Holocaust education is a core part of the school system. It also has stringent laws combating Holocaust denial. And just last week, the German parliament commemorated Nazi victims persecuted for their sexual or gender identity.   
   
      However, over the past several decades, Germany has been quietly betraying the memory of Holocaust victims by naming streets, schools and medical facilities in honor of Nazi Party members and SS officers – men who used slave labor from concentration camps, armed the Third Reich and directly enabled the genocide. 
   
      A country can’t claim to fully respect Holocaust remembrance while simultaneously glorifying the people who made the Holocaust possible. And Germany has been long overdue in facing this hypocrisy.  
   
      Money solves a lot of problems, even – or perhaps especially – if one’s a war criminal. In 1948, a Nuremberg tribunal convicted industrial magnate Alfried Krupp of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Krupp’s empire not only armed Nazi Germany, but had around 100,000 slave laborers, including concentration camp inmates, and a factory at Auschwitz.
   
      Krupp ended up serving a total of six years before his sentence was commuted, and he was given back his seized assets – much of which was procured off of war and genocide. Before his death in 1967, he bequeathed his fortune to what became the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, which commenced pumping millions into charitable causes. 
   
      Unsurprisingly, many of its projects ended up honoring Krupp – transforming him from a convicted war criminal to visionary philanthropist whose name graces a college, institute, hospital, nursing home and concert hall. As well as numerous university scholarships and endowments financed by his foundation.  
   
      Last year, a Jacobs University Bremen spokesperson was refreshingly blunt in telling me the school had received 10 million deutschmarks from Krupp’s foundation, “and with this donation the name ‘Alfried Krupp College’ has been given.” 
   
      But Krupp is hardly an isolated case. Klaus Bahlsen was a Nazi Party member who funded the SS – the party’s military wing responsible for orchestrating the Holocaust. During the war, Bahlsen and his two brothers ran a biscuit conglomerate that had more than 2,150 slaves in a factory in Nazi-occupied Ukraine; additionally, more than 700 mostly Polish and Ukrainian women were forcibly sent to labor for the Bahlsens in Hanover. 
   
      Bahlsen, like Krupp, established a charity that pours millions into public works, many of which are named after him and done in partnership with municipal governments. Bahlsen’s biography on the Rut and Klaus Bahlsen Foundation’s webpage makes no mention of his Nazi membership or use of slave labor. (Klaus’ wife, Rut Bahlsen – the foundation’s other namesake – wasn’t affiliated with the Nazis as far as it is known).
   
      Indeed, the historical whitewashing has been so blatant that, in 2019, the heiress to Bahlsen’s fortune indignantly asserted her family’s slaves were treated “well.” After international condemnation, she issued an apology. 
   
      Sadly, it doesn’t stop with Bahlsen either. Friedrich Flick, another magnate convicted of crimes against humanity in Nuremberg, has a foundation and several streets bearing his name. Multiple cities have streets honoring Ferdinand Porsche, Hitler’s favorite car designer whose Volkswagen plant murdered an estimated 350 to 400 infants. (Although Porsche was detained by the Allies, he was never tried for war crimes. As the US Holocaust Memorial Museum puts it, “Justice was scant for Volkswagen perpetrators.”) 
   
      And, in 2015, the city of Coburg named a street for Nazi war profiteer Max Brose, who also has an eponymous foundation, despite an outcry from Germany’s main Jewish organization. 
   
      Meanwhile, Hamburg celebrates the Nazi Kurt Körber, technical director of Dresden Universelle-Werke, which had up to 3,000 forced laborers during the war, including at least 700 female concentration camp inmates. Hamburg, which has been lavished with money by Körber’s foundation, has a school, street and sprawling new center named for him. 
   
      These are just some examples: Germany is riddled with places named for other Nazi Party members as well as antisemitic academics, authors, composers and poets who vociferously welcomed Adolf Hitler’s rise. 
   
      How does one defend the indefensible? Mostly by obfuscation and deception.  
   
      Over the past decade, numerous German cities, including Berlin, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich and Dusseldorf, commissioned panels to identify problematic place names. 
   
      Around the same time, some companies and foundations named after Nazis hired historians to dig into their honorees’ pasts. The resulting reports provide the illusion of public and private leadership taking steps to confront Germany’s Third Reich legacy. 
   
      Unfortunately, in many of these cases, the place names flagged by the reports remain unchanged and the corporations continue memorializing their Nazi founders. Indeed, by brazenly publishing these reports, the cities and foundations make it clear they know exactly who they’re honoring and have consciously elected to continue doing so.  
   
      Another benefit of such studies is they deceive the public by presenting something clear-cut – the glorification of Nazi slavers – as a nuanced issue worthy of discussion. This creates the false premise there are multiple angles to the story; in other words, the studies allow for the “both siding” of Nazis. 
   
      The inherent absurdity can be striking. Last February, the Krupp foundation – named for a Nazi convicted of crimes against humanity at Nuremberg – unveiled the beginning of a study exploring Krupp’s “relationship toward National Socialism.” Imagine an organization named for Osama bin Laden, another deceased multi-millionaire with a penchant for mass murder, hiring historians to examine bin Laden’s relationship toward Islamic terrorism. 
   
      Or take BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt, whose namesake ran a battery company that forced concentration camp inmates to work in such barbaric conditions it killed an average of 80 slaves a month.  
   
      The history section of the foundation’s site contains information about Quandt’s past referencing a report that was done into his personal history. According to the foundation’s summary of the findings, “Many forced laborers fell ill and did not survive these cruel conditions. As personnel manager, Herbert Quandt, who joined the NSDAP [Nazi Party] in 1940, was aware of the conditions in the factories.” Yet the foundation’s mission statement is to promote “responsible leadership.”
   
      Reporting on Nazi-named foundations invariably leads to the question of what next. Isn’t it good that money, much of it made off of war crimes, is being put to benevolent purposes?  
   
      This is another example of obfuscation, which enables the whitewashing of Nazis. It’s predicated upon a false choice: either you let them build charities, schools and streets named after Third Reich figures, or they’ll take their money elsewhere.
   
      No such choice exists. Several of the foundations in question are large entities tied to businesses. They’re a part of society and can be influenced just like any other corporation.  
   
      Indeed, there are examples, both in Europe and the US, of public pushback preventing the glorification of slavers without ending the funding. This was the case with Frankfurt’s Goethe University in 2019, when student and faculty protests led to the renaming of a campus lounge that honored a Nazi Party member who used slave labor.
   
      Otherwise, insisting we must acquiesce to honoring Nazis – lest the charities withhold their money – is tantamount to letting them hold their victims hostage in death as they imprisoned their bodies in life.  
   
      Today’s resurgence of global White supremacy has brought us horrific images of far-right groups in Eastern Europe holding marches to honor local Holocaust perpetrators.  
   
      Germany’s approach is less vulgar yet exponentially more hypocritical. It takes schoolchildren on concentration camp visits and to history museums. It lectures other nations about Holocaust denial. It goes out of its way to sentence a 97-year-old former Nazi secretary.  
   
      And it does all this while some of its elite institutions, universities and municipalities thrive on Nazi money in exchange for rehabilitating the images of prominent Third Reich slavers.

      Armani Kelly, 28, Dante Wicker, 31 and Montoya Givens, 31, who are all associates, were supposed to perform at a club in Detroit on January 21, according to Michael McGinnis, commander of major crimes.
   
      “It’s our understanding that the performance got canceled, and from there – we just have a whole lot of unanswered questions that we are trying to find out,” McGinnis said. All of their phones “stopped having activity” by the early morning hours of January 22, McGinnis added.
   
      “The mother of one of the victims, the next day, made a report of the missing person. That mother became very proactive in the investigation and started searching for her vehicle through OnStar,” McGinnis said.
   
      The mom found the car in Warren, Michigan, McGinnis said, where authorities recovered the car on January 23. By January 27, information about Kelly’s disappearance was spreading throughout the media, McGinnis said.  
   
      “Once that happens, other family members of the other missings come to realize that that’s a friend of their loved ones and they haven’t seen them either, so then they both get reported missing,” McGinnis said.
   
      “We want to find them and get them home to their loved ones,” he said. “Really think about the victims’ families in this case, they have no answers. They don’t know where their loved one is.
   
      “We need help,” McGinnis said. “If somebody knows something, we’re asking please call and share that information with us.”

      “I don’t want to be on ‘Dateline’ in 20 years to find his body,” she said.

                (PFE) to make and sell the vaccine, was up about 1% as well. 
   
      But a big part of the problem for Pfizer, as well as vaccine rival Moderna
            
                (MRNA), is that public health care agencies already had an ample supply of vaccines and pills to help prevent the spread of Covid and treat those who contract the virus.
   
      The company also is now factoring in zero revenue for Paxlovid from China after April 1, since the Chinese government is removing the antiviral pill from its list of treatments that are eligible for reimbursement as part of its national insurance program.
   
      Pfizer noted that it now expects to sell just $13.5 billion of its vaccine and $8 billion of the Paxlovid pill this year. Wall Street was expecting vaccine revenue of $14.4 billion and $10.3 billion of Paxlovid for 2023, according to estimates tracked by Refinitiv. 
   
      Pfizer reported Comirnaty sales of $37.8 billion last year and revenue of $18.9 billion from Paxlovid.
   
      Pfizer said in its earnings release that sales from Covid products are expected to rise again in 2024 “after reaching a low point in 2023 due to significant government supply on hand to start the year.”
   
      Still, as the world adapts to the fact that Covid is not going away, Pfizer is going to try to find new blockbuster medications.
   
      “Our focus is always on what is next. As we turn to 2023, we expect to once again set records, with potentially the largest number of new product and indication launches that we’ve ever had in such a short period of time,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla in the earnings press release.
   
      Pfizer has completed a series of acquisitions over the past few years in order to gain access to promising new medications. It spent about $25 billion to buy Biohaven Pharmaceutical, Arena Pharmaceuticals and Global Blood Therapeutics.
   
      Pfizer now has several cancer and inflammatory disease drugs in its pipeline as well as a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 
   
      But Wall Street is growing impatient.
   
      Shares of Pfizer are down more than 15% so far in 2023, following a 13% drop last year. The stock surged more than 60% in 2021 due to strong sales for its vaccine.

      Use of marijuana and other substances dropped in teenagers during the first year of the pandemic, according to a new study.
   
      But adults’ use of cannabis, illegal drugs and alcohol, including binge drinking, either stayed the same or increased compared to the two years before Covid-19.
   
      “Substance use decreased between 2019 and 2020 among those aged 13 to 20 years,” wrote first author Dr. Wilson Compton, deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
   
      However, “consistent declines were not seen in older persons other than tobacco use reductions, and cannabis use increased among adults ages 25 years and older,” he and his coauthors wrote.
   
      The study analyzed data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, which follows tobacco and other substance use over time among 49,000 US youths and adults. 
   
      “A particular strength of this study was the longitudinal design,” said Joseph Palamar, an associate professor of population health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study.
   
      “This design allows us to look at changes among the same people over time as opposed to other national studies which compare different groups of people across time,” he said. 
   
      Substance abuse dropped in teenagers between ages 13 and 17, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open.
   
      Cannabis use among teenagers ages 13 and 15 dropped by 3.4 percentage points in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019, while tobacco use declined by about 4 points, the study found. The use of other illegal or misused prescription drugs also fell 2.5 percentage points in this age group.
   
      Use of marijuana in teens ages 16 and 17 dropped 7.3 percentage points in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019.  Tobacco use fell by over 10 points and misuse of drugs sank by nearly 3 percentage points. Binge drinking dipped by 1.6 percentage points across the age group.
   
      “I think availability plays a big part,” Palamar said. “If high schoolers are separated from their friends for a long time and stuck inside, they’ll likely have decreased access to drugs.
   
      “Even if a teen successfully obtained weed, this doesn’t mean he or she had somewhere away from parents to smoke it if the whole family was on lockdown,” he added.
   
      The use of alcohol increased by over five percentage points (from 60.2% to 65.2%)  among adults ages 21 to 24 years old in 2020 compared to the previous two years. Binge drinking, however, fell by 2.2 points.
   
      Tobacco use fell by about 8 percentage points, but use of marijuana and other illegal or prescription drugs did not change significantly in this age group, according to the study. 
   
      Use of marijuana increased slightly in adults 25 and up, by 1.2 percentage points. Declines in other substance abuse in this age group were not significant, the study authors said.
   
      Tobacco use fell for all adults, the study found. The number of young adults ages 18 to 20 smoking tobacco dropped by just over 15 percentage points in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019. Smoking also declined by about 8 points in adults ages 21 and up over the same period. 
   
      However, a drop in drug use during the early days of Covid did not mean the reduction continued as the pandemic wore on, said Palamar, who has been studying drug availability during that period.
   
      “Decreases in use during the early months of Covid are meaningful, but we need to keep in mind that use of some drugs rebounded,” Palamar said. “For example, we found that seizures of marijuana and methamphetamine decreased after the start of Covid, and then rebounded to a much higher rate later in the year.”
   
A separate survey of people ages 19 to 30 found they were using marijuana and hallucinogens at high rates in 2021. The Monitoring the Future Study, published in 2022, found 11% of people in this age group used marijuana on a daily basis in 2021, while 43% said they had used it in the past year.

      US home prices dropped for the fifth month in a row in November, as rising mortgage rates pushed prospective buyers out of the housing market late last year and prices continued to cool, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, released Tuesday.
   
      Last July marked the first month-over-month decrease for the national index since February 2012 and that continued through November, with seasonally adjusted prices falling 0.3% month over month.
   
      All cities in the 20-city index reported declines before seasonal adjustments. After seasonal adjustments, 19 cities still reported declines, with only Detroit increasing 0.1%.
   
      “November 2022 marked the fifth consecutive month of declining home prices in the US,” said Craig J. Lazzara, managing director at S&P DJI. “As the Federal Reserve moves interest rates higher, mortgage financing continues to be a headwind for home prices.” 
   
      Compared to prices from the year before, US home prices nudged higher in November, but the pace of that growth slowed from prior months.
   
      Home prices rose 7.7% in November from the year before, a smaller jump than the 9.2% growth seen in October, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, released Tuesday.
   
      Cities in the South led price appreciation, with Miami; Atlanta; and Tampa, Florida, all reporting the highest year-over-year gains among the cities in the 20-city index in November. Miami led the way with an 18.4% price increase from the year prior, followed by Tampa and Atlanta. All 20 cities reported lower price increases in the year ending November 2022 compared to the year ending October 2022.
   
      Economic weakness, including the possibility of a recession, could continue to hold back potential buyers, said Lazzara. 
   
      “Given these prospects for a challenging macroeconomic environment, home prices may well continue to weaken,” he said.
   
      The November report provides evidence of the slowing housing market during the fall, said Lisa Sturtevant, Bright MLS chief economist, but it may not show the worst yet of the housing market.
   
      “The home price data released today do not account for the full impact of rising mortgage rates, which were above 7% early in November, and led to a significant pullback in buyer activity,” she said. “In many local markets across the country, home prices have fallen precipitously from their summer peaks as buyers were forced out of the market due to affordability challenges.”
   
      But, she said, talk of a major market correction is just hyperbole.
   
      “We may have already seen the bottom of the housing market,” she said. 
   
      Mortgage rates fell throughout January, prompting more buyers to view properties and make offers. Inflation has begun to ease, boosting consumer confidence. Pending home sales improved in December and homebuilder confidence ticked up in January.
   
      “Many agents and brokers are expecting a robust spring housing market, and the overall mood in the market feels much more optimistic than even a month ago,” she said.
   
      Inventory of available homes to buy remains the stubborn sticking point for many buyers. Many current homeowners are hesitant to sell when they have very attractive rates under 4% and buying a new home would mean getting a much higher rate.
   
      “Home shoppers are still going to find limited supply in the market and affordability is still a major challenge, particularly for first-time homebuyers,” Sturtevant said. “The persistent lack of inventory, exacerbated by this ‘rate lock,’ is the main reason why we should expect prices to be stable or even rise in the year ahead.”

      Rep. George Santos told the House GOP conference on Tuesday behind closed doors he wants off of his two committees until his issues are resolved, three members told CNN.
   
      The New York Republican who has faced calls for his resignation for false statements – including regarding his professional experience, education history and identity – is a member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Committee on Small Business. Federal prosecutors are also investigating Santos’ finances, and he continues to face a myriad of questions about his personal finances.
   
      He was first elected last fall. 
   
      Santos later told reporters the choice to step back from his committee posts was his.
   
      “Nobody tells me to do anything,” Santos said. “I made that decision on my own that I thought best represented in the interest of the voters.” 
   
      House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters that Santos will “have a voice here in Congress, and until he answers all those questions, then at that time he’ll be able to be seated on committees.”
   
      “I met with George Santos yesterday and I think it was an appropriate decision that, until he can clear everything up, he’s off the committee’s right now,” McCarthy told reporters.
   
      Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia told CNN that it was Santos’ decision that he made on his own to “abstain” from the committees. She said he told the conference he would step aside from the committees as the GOP is trying to oust Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota from the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   
      Democrats have cited the mounting false statements and scrutiny facing Santos as an example of hypocrisy for Republicans booting Omar and two other House Democrats – California Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell – off committee assignments. While Schiff and Swalwell were able to be ejected from the House Intelligence Committee unilaterally by McCarthy, Omar’s position on House Foreign Affairs will need a vote on the House floor, one that Republican leaders have yet to force. 
   
      “He just felt like there was so much drama really over the situation, and especially what we’re doing to work to remove Ilhan Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee,” Greene told CNN.
   
      She added: “But Mr. Santos’ statement in there was just saying that he spoke with Speaker McCarthy and made this decision on his own.” 
   
      Small Business Committee Chairman Roger Williams, a Republican from Texas, said that he thinks Santos “probably made the right decision” to step down from his committee assignments until the questions about his past and his financial irregularities are resolved. 
   
      Santos on Tuesday offered a single regret and litany of grievances against the media in an interview with right-wing One America News that papered over his assorted personal lies and ignored more serious allegations against him. He promised to turn over a new leaf and asked that voters accept that what he did “during the campaign does not reflect the (work of his Congressional) office.”
   
      Leaving his office late last week on Capitol Hill, Santos told a reporter that he would put together a news conference “soon” to “address everything.”
   
      “We’ll give you all the answers to everything you’re asking for,” he said.
   
      In recent days, Santos has faced a series of questions regarding his campaign finances, including inquiries about donors as well as campaign disbursements, including dozens of expenses his campaign has reported at exactly $199.99, one cent below the threshold above which the campaign is required to retain receipts.
   
      The Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint with the FEC that describes his disbursements as “odd and seemingly impossible.” It notes that one of the $199.99 expenses was purported to be for a “hotel stay” at the luxury W Hotel South Beach in Florida in October 2021, where the lowest-price room typically would have cost more than $700.
   
      Last week, Santos also filed a slew of amended reports with the FEC that only added to the confusion about the source of loans he has said he made to his campaign.
   
      In some filings, the campaign did not check boxes denoting that two six-figure loans came from the candidate’s personal funds.
   
      Santos also is facing questions about who is serving as his campaign’s treasurer.
   
      His longtime treasurer, Nancy Marks, on Tuesday submitted letters to the Federal Election Commission, saying she had formally resigned the position January 25.
   
      Despite that, Marks’ signature still appeared on some year-end reports filed late Tuesday for fundraising committees associated with Santos. The campaign’s report, filed later Tuesday night, was signed by another treasurer, Andrew Olson. It included a note that said it had “been filed based on the limited information provided to the campaign from the previous treasurer Nancy Marks.”
   
      Santos’ campaign had filed paperwork January 25 naming a Wisconsin-based consultant, Thomas Datwyler, as treasurer.
   
      But Datwyler’s lawyer told CNN that Datwyler had declined the post and had been listed as treasurer without his authorization. The lawyer, Derek Ross, said Datwyler told the agency on Friday that his name should be removed name from Santos’ filings. And in a letter to the FEC, Ross requested that election regulators refer the matter to “the appropriate law enforcement agency to determine whether a crime has occurred.”
   
      Faced with a series of softball questions on One America News, Santos allowed that he was wrong to have lied about his education, saying, “It was a bad decision, poor judgment. I felt the need to do it because I felt that without a diploma, I’d be looked down on and ‘less-than’ the other people.”
   
      “I’ve learned my lesson,” Santos added, “and now I can guarantee you that from now on, anything and everything is going to be above board. It’s largely always been above board, I’m just now going to go the extra step to double check, cross reference, everything.”
   
      Notably, Santos was not asked about issues surrounding his campaign finances or animal charity, or the many claims that he has made that have been debunked or called into question, including about Jewish ancestry, his mother’s location on September 11, 2001, and his employment history.
   
      Asked by OAN what emotions he feels now, Santos said “sad.”
   
      “Sad that I put myself in this predicament, and I own up to it,” he said. “But I’m sad, sad that the media has decided now to target my family, the media has decided to target and harass my friends. Anybody around me.”
   
      Santos also back-handedly backed off a previous line, from last year, in which he blamed President Joe Biden for creating a political environment in which lying was acceptable.
   
      Lightly pressed on whether his “exaggerations” became “larger” as he came closer to office, Santos demurred, saying, “You’d have to define ‘exaggerations.’”

      Actress Annie Wersching passed away of cancer early Sunday morning, her publicist, Craig Schneider told CNN. Wersching was 45 years old.
   
      She was best known for playing FBI agent Renee Walker in the series “24.”
   
      Wersching’s husband, Stephen Full, released a statement to CNN:
   
      “There is a cavernous hole in the soul of this family today. But she left us the tools to fill it. She found wonder in the simplest moment. She didn’t require music to dance. She taught us not to wait for adventure to find you. ‘Go find it. It’s everywhere.’ And find it we shall,” he wrote.
   
      Wersching also provided the voice for Tess in “The Last of Us” video game. Neil Druckmann, the creative director of new HBO Max series “The Last of Us” based on the game, tweeted on Wesching’s passing: 
   
      “Just found out my dear friend, Annie Wersching, passed away. We just lost a beautiful artist and human being. My heart is shattered. Thoughts are with her loved ones.”
   
      (CNN and HBO Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)
   
      A GoFundMe was set up by “Handmaid’s Tale” actress Ever Carradine in support of Annie’s children and husband “so they can continue to live life in a way that they know would make Annie proud.”
   
      Wersching regularly appeared in television dramas throughout the aughts and into the 2010s. In 2007, she played Amelia Joffe on the long-running ABC soap “General Hospital.” Her breakout role came in 2008 when she portrayed FBI agent Renee Walker on the hit Fox show “24,” starring alongside Kiefer Sutherland throughout the seventh and eighth seasons.
   
      Some of Wersching’s other notable TV credits include her role as the love interest of Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver) on Amazon Prime’s 2014 series “Bosch” and a recurring role as the villainous vampire Lily Salvatore on the CW’s “The Vampire Diaries.”
   
      Portraying the Borg Queen in “Star Trek Picard” in 2022, Wersching frequently shared photos of herself from set in full costume accompanied by messages of gratitude for the makeup and prosthetics artists that transformed her into the intergalactic villain. Wersching’s role in “Star Trek Picard,” which airs on Paramount+, is listed as one of the actress’s last professional credits on IMDb. 
   
      Wersching’s husband concluded his statement with a touching memory on Sunday.
   
      “As I drove our boys, the true loves of her life, down the winding driveway and street, she would yell BYE! until we were out of earshot and into the world. I can still hear it ringing. Bye my Buddie. ‘I love you little family…’”

      The matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will be the first in Super Bowl history to feature two Black starting quarterbacks, as Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts bid to lead their teams to glory on the biggest stage of all. 
   
      Black quarterbacks have featured and won the Super Bowl in the past but never has there been two Black quarterbacks starting for each side. 
   
      Mahomes, who became the third Black quarterback to win the Super Bowl in 2020, is aiming to become the first Black quarterback in NFL history to win multiple Super Bowls, while Eagles quarterback Hurts could become the fourth Black quarterback to win the Lombardi Trophy.
   
      Doug Williams was the first Black quarterback to start and win the Super Bowl, leading the then-Washington Redskins to victory in 1988, and was followed by Russell Wilson for the Seattle Seahawks in 2014 and Mahomes in 2020, while others have started and lost the big game.
   
      Mahomes powered through an ankle injury to inspire his team to a 23-20 victory in the AFC Championship against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.
   
      Clearly struggling with the pain, the 27-year-old produced an inspired performance, throwing for 326 yards and two touchdowns. 
   
      “I don’t think we have any cigars, but we’ll be ready to go at the Super Bowl,” Mahomes told CBS after the game, not wanting to get too excited. 
   
      Earlier in the day, Eagles quarterback Hurts passed Cam Newton for the most rushing touchdowns in a single season by a quarterback as he guided his team past the San Francisco 49ers, 31-7. 
   
      “I don’t really know how to feel, to be honest,” he told reporters after reaching the Super Bowl. 
   
      “You work really hard to put yourself in this position and I’m forever grateful. Only God knows the things that each individual on this team has been able to overcome for us to come together as a team and do something special as a group. 
   
      “That’s what means the most. I always want to go out there and give my best regardless of what’s going on because I don’t want to let down the guy next to me.” 
   
      Super Bowl LVII will take place on February 12.

      Ashton Kutcher is reflecting on one of the most difficult periods of his public life – his 2011 separation from then-wife Demi Moore.
   
      In a new interview with Esquire published on Tuesday, the actor recalled how his “life changed” when he began his relationship with Moore in 2003, amid a tabloid frenzy.
   
      “I was twenty-six, bearing the responsibility of an eight-year-old, a ten-year-old, and a twelve-year-old,” he shared, referencing Moore’s now-grown three daughters with her ex-husband Bruce Willis, Tallulah, Scout and Rumer Willis, with whom Kutcher still maintains a relationship.
   
      Kutcher and Moore ultimately divorced in 2013, which Kutcher said made him feel like a “failure.”
   
      “Nothing makes you feel like a failure like divorce,” he said. “Divorce feels like a wholesale f**king failure. You failed at marriage.”
   
      After that relationship, Kutcher went on to date his former “That ’70s Show” costar Mila Kunis, and they married in 2015. They have two children.
   
      Kutcher told Esquire that he was upset when the release of Moore’s tell-all memoir in 2019 invited renewed attention from tabloids.
   
      “I was f**king pissed,” he said. “I’d finally gotten to a place where the press had really laid off me and Mila, and my life and my family. And then the next day, (the paparazzi) are at my kids’ school.” 
   
      Nonetheless, Kutcher now has much to be grateful for. He stars in a new romantic comedy with Reese Witherspoon, “Your Place or Mine,” out next month on Netflix, which marks his return to the silver screen almost nine years since his last leading role in a film. 
   
      He also recently appeared in the first episode of Netflix’s reboot “That ’90s Show,” in which he again plays Kelso, the role that first put him on the map in “That ’70s Show,” which ran on Fox from 1998-2006.

      “I just couldn’t find any good research base on this,” said Levine, chair of the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. 
   
      Now, it seems it’s the only thing anyone wants to talk to him about.
   
      “Santos has brought more reporters to me in the last couple of weeks than probably in the last year,” Levine said.
   
      Santos, of course, is US Rep. George Santos, a Republican from Long Island who was recently elected to represent New York’s third congressional district.  
   
      In the months since his election, key claims from Santos’ biography – including where he earned his college degree, his employment at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, an animal rescue group he says he founded and his Jewish religious affiliation – have withered under the scrutiny of reporters and fact-checkers. Now, he says, he doesn’t have a college degree; he wasn’t employed by Citigroup or Goldman Sachs; and the IRS has no record of his animal rescue group. He also says he never claimed to be Jewish, but rather he was “Jew-ish.”
   
      Santos defended himself in media interviews in December, saying that the discrepancies were the result of résumé padding and poor word choices but that he was not a criminal or a fraud. 
   
      It’s not clear what is driving Santos’ statements. 
   
      But the story has given professionals who study lying in its most extreme forms a rare moment to raise awareness about lying as a mental disorder – one they say has been largely neglected by doctors and therapists.
   
      “It is rare to find a public figure who lies so frequently in such verifiable ways,” says Christian Hart, a psychologist who directs the Human Deception Laboratory at Texas Woman’s University.  
   
      Psychiatrists have recognized pathological lying as a mental affliction since the late 1800s, yet experts say it has never been given serious attention, funding or real study. It doesn’t have its own diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, the bible of psychiatry. Instead, it is recognized as a feature of other diagnoses, like personality disorders.  
   
      As a result, there’s no evidence-based way to treat it, even though many pathological liars say they want help to stop.
   
      The standard approach to treating lying relies on techniques borrowed from cognitive behavioral therapy, which emphasizes understanding and changing thinking patterns. But no one is sure that this is the most effective way to help.
   
      We don’t know necessarily what’s the most effective treatment,” said Drew Curtis, an associate professor of psychology at Angelo State University in Texas who studies pathological lying.
   
      Curtis had someone offer to drive across the country to see him for treatment, which he says he wasn’t able to offer.
   
      “So that’s the heartbreaking side of it for me, as a clinician: people that are wanting to help and can’t have the help,” Curtis said.
   
      Longtime collaborators Curtis and Hart recently published a study laying out evidence to support the inclusion of pathological lying as a standalone diagnosis in the DSM.
   
      Over the years, Hart said, almost 20 people have proposed definitions of pathological lying, but there’s very little overlap between them: “The only truly common feature is that these people lie a lot.”
   
      The first thing to know about pathological or compulsive lying is that it is rare, Levine says. His studies show that most people tell the truth most of the time.  
   
      “These really prolific liars are pretty unusual,” said Levine, whose book about deception, “Duped,” was published in 2019.
   
      Which isn’t to say that lying isn’t common. Most people lie sometimes, even daily. In his studies, people lied up to twice a day, on average.   
   
      Levine himself regularly lies at the grocery store when workers ask whether he found everything he was looking for.  Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, that answer is almost always no, but he says yes anyway.
   
      One of his students worked in a retail clothing store and regularly lied to people who were trying on clothes. Another – a receptionist – lied to cover for a doctor who was always running late.
   
      That’s all pretty normal, Levine said. He believes that honesty is our default mode of communication simply because people have to be honest with each other to work effectively in big groups, something humans do uniquely well in the animal kingdom.
   
      But sticking to the facts isn’t easy for everyone.
   
      In their studies, Hart and Curtis have found that most people tell an average of about one lie a day. That’s pretty normal. Then there are people who lie a lot: about 10 lies a day, on average.
   
      Hart and Curtis call prolific or especially consequential liars – someone like Bernie Madoff, who dupes and defrauds investors, for example – “Big Liars,” which is also the title of their recent book. 
   
      Big lying is pretty unusual. Pathological lying is even more rare than that.  
   
      Hart thinks he’s only ever interacted with two people that met the classical case study description of pathological lying.
   
      “It was dizzying,” Hart says.
   
      When people start to lie so much that they can’t stop or that it begins to hurt them or people around them, that’s when it becomes abnormal and may need treatment.
   
      “It’s more the clinical category of people who tell excessive amounts of lies that impairs their functioning, causes distress, and poses some risk to themselves or others,” Curtis said, sharing the working definition of pathological lying that he and Hart hope will eventually be included in the DSM.
   
      “What we found, examining all the cases, is that the lying appears to be somewhat compulsive,” Hart said. “That is, they’re lying in situations when a reasonable person probably wouldn’t lie, and it seems like even to their own detriment in many cases.
   
      “It tends to cause dysfunction in their lives,” Hart said, including social, relationship and employment problems. 
   
      On some level, pathological liars know they’re lying.  When confronted with their lies, they’ll typically admit to their dishonesty.
   
      Lying can also be a feature of other disorders, but Hart says that when they assessed people who met the criteria for pathological lying, they found something interesting.
   
      “It turned out that the majority of them don’t have another psychological disorder. And so it seems like lying is their principal problem,” he said, lending weight to the idea that it deserves to be its own diagnosis.
   
      The American Psychiatric Association, or APA, publishes the DSM and regularly reviews proposals for new diagnoses. Curtis says he has been gathering evidence and is in the process of filling out the paperwork the APA requires to consider whether pathological lying should be a new diagnosis.
   
      As for whether certain professions seem to attract people who lie more than average, Hart says that’s a complicated question.
   
      It’s not that people who lie a lot tend to gravitate to certain jobs. Rather, certain jobs – like sales, for example – probably reward the ability to lie smoothly, and so these professions may be more likely to have a higher concentration of people who lie more than average.
   
      “The evidence we have suggests that politicians aren’t by their nature any more dishonest than the typical person,” Hart said.  “However, when people go into politics, there’s pretty good evidence that the most successful politicians are the ones that are more willing to bend the truth” and so they may be the ones more likely to be re-elected.
   
      Only time will tell, how the situation may play out for Santos.
   
      So far, he has resisted calls to step down, saying he intends to serve his term in Congress. This week, though, Santos announced he would step down from any committee assignments while the investigations are ongoing.

      Republicans announced Thursday that Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will deliver the party’s response to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address next week. Sanders, the former White House press secretary and daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, is part of a larger effort by Republicans to repackage Trumpism in a way that seems more palatable. 
   
      Sanders represents a new generation of Republicans eager to weaponize the same outrage machine with familiar talking points about the threats of immigration, the so-called radical left’s attacks on education and an economy in shambles under Biden – while showing that they can govern without the self-defeating chaos and tumult that rocked the nation from 2017 to 2021.
   
      The 40-year-old certainly provides a contrast to the 76-year-old former President Donald Trump by virtue of her age and gender. It’s also worth noting her past experience working in the George W. Bush administration – an experience that ties her to the Republican establishment. 
   
      But Trump has remade the Republican Party in his image, and Sanders is falling back on the same culture war playbook he used and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis polished. Since she was sworn in as governor at the start of the year, she has taken aim at critical race theory in the classroom and the use of the phrase “Latinx” in state documents. 
   
      None of this should come as a surprise. Sanders stood by former President Donald Trump during the most controversial of controversial moments and defended his family separation policy at the border, insisting that it was the law and that the president was merely enforcing it. She also shares Trump’s resentments, with a view of a world where “everybody’s against us, everybody’s looking down on us,” as John Brummett, a political columnist in Arkansas, told the New Yorker in 2019. 
   
      Echoing the rhetoric of Trump and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich — who pioneered the kind of smashmouth, no-guardrails partisanship that shapes the modern GOP — Sanders announced Thursday that she was a part of a new group of leaders in her party who were “ready to defend our freedom against the radical left…”
 
      But Sanders also promised to present an “optimistic vision for the future” in her rebuttal. Given that Trump’s vision was rooted in fear, hate and grievances, her attempted rebranding might be the next stage in the evolution of the GOP.
   
      Sanders’ star role should send something of a warning to Trump, who learned this week his former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley is expected to announce her bid for president in 2024. Haley, who could pose a serious threat to Trump in the Republican primary, is in some ways the face of the modern GOP. 
   
      As a conservative woman born to immigrant parents, she has an extensive record as governor of South Carolina. Though she espouses many of the extreme views held by her former boss, backing his decision to withdraw the US from key international commitments including the Paris climate agreement, for example, Haley will likely sell her competence and ability to promote conservative goals through more traditional political processes. 
   
      But will any kind of Republican repackaging effort work? It remains to be seen what Sanders has in store when it comes to optimism – an outlook that seems at odds with conservativism. As for candidates like Haley, voters can likely discern the same old policies and ideas, even when they’re touted by different candidates. 
   
      The Republican Party has become increasingly extreme over the past few decades, not just because of the officials at the top of the party but because of the themes that they have chosen to focus on. And swing voters who might otherwise be attracted to new Republican faces and hardline positions on issues like crime could still be turned off by the radicalism of the basic Republican agenda, even if there is less toxic tweeting and unconventional political theatrics. 
   
      Moreover, Sanders is faced with a tall order next week, given that the list of those who respond to the State of the Union is haunted with once promising political stars. It’s a hard act to follow the commander in chief, and those chosen to represent the opposition party rarely pull it off. 
   
      Since 1966, when Sen. Everett Dirksen of Illinois and Rep. Gerald Ford of Michigan delivered a relatively successful joint response to President Lyndon Johnson, parties have tried to figure out a way to make these work. But they rarely do. Who can forget Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida in 2013, who seemed to move his career 30 steps back when he reached over for a gulp of water right in the middle of speaking, or Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, whose uninspired delivery in 2009 gave comedians fodder for months? Democrats have struggled too, with Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius giving a sleepy response after President George W. Bush in 2008.  
   
      The jury’s still out on whether Republican voters really want a change from Trump. Despite all the conversations in the media about whether Trump will start a civil war within the party and force the GOP to undergo a transformation in order to broaden its reach, party support for him remained relatively strong after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. But there are signs that his hold on the party may be weakening, with a CNN/SSRS poll in December finding that 6 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents wanted their party to nominate someone other than Trump in 2024. 
   
      Ultimately, Republicans are thirsty for power and eager to win back the White House in 2024. Many of them are still bitter about the outcome of the 2020 election and frustrated that Biden has enjoyed legislative success and an unexpectedly good midterm election result. If someone like Sanders can make the case that Trumpism needs a rebrand — and embraces many of the same core positions as the former president without the chaos and inefficiency, adds a dash of optimism and demonstrates the GOP is not just a party of angry White men — that might open a window for a new slate of candidates to jump into the contest for the 2024 nomination.

      Nick Carter is countersuing two women who accused him of committing sexual assault on two occasions more than 15 years ago.
   
      Carter’s legal response comes after Shannon “Shay” Ruth filed a sexual battery lawsuit against him in Clark County, Nevada, in December.
   
      Ruth, a 39-year-old woman who says she lives with with autism and cerebral palsy, alleges that Carter gave her alcohol and assaulted her after a concert in Tacoma, Washington in February 2001. She was 17 at the time of the alleged incident.
   
      Carter has denied the allegation.
   
      “Having met and encountered millions of fans over the course of his 34-year career, it would be impossible for Carter to definitively know if he ever actually crossed paths with Ruth,” his countersuit, filed in Clark County on Thursday and obtained by CNN, states. “Carter is certain that he did not have sex with Ruth, did not grab her arm, and did not sexually assault or bully her.”
   
      He also alleges that Ruth was “groomed and coached,” in part, by Melissa Schuman Henschel and her father, Jerome Schuman. 
   
      In 2017, Schuman Henschel accused Carter of raping her 15 years prior. Carter denied Schuman Henschel’s allegation, stating in part, “Melissa never expressed to me while we were together or at any time since that anything we did was not consensual.”
   
      Prosecutors in Los Angeles, where Schuman sought to bring charges against Carter, said in a filing at the time that they declined the matter without analyzing the “strengths and weaknesses of the evidence.”
   
      Carter’s counterclaim also named Schuman Henschel’s father Jerome as a counter-defendent along with twenty unnamed people and corporations whom Carter alleges “are responsible for damages he suffered.”
   
      Additionally, Carter’s filings allege that Ruth made false reports to police with “significant and numerous discrepancies and inconsistencies in her reports.” He  claims that Ruth previously admitted that she was not sexually assaulted by Carter and that the two women are taking advantage of the #MeToo movement.
   
      “In an important development in recent American history, the #MeToo movement was born and rightfully created a platform for victims of abuse,” the suit states. “Unfortunately, some people chose to take advantage of that platform. Those individuals felt that any voice and any accusation, right or wrong, would carry the day because the world was finally listening to accusers.” 
   
      CNN has reached out to representatives for Carter, Ruth, Schuman Henschel and ABC for comment.
   
      Carter has not been charged criminally in relation to Ruth’s allegation.
   
      The singer is seeking more than $2.3 million in damages, citing a decision by ABC to cancel the television special “A Very Backstreet Holiday” amid Ruth’s suit. He is also seeking punitive and emotional distress damages to be determined by the court, along with attorney’s fees. 
   
      “Why should Nick Carter be believed with his long history of abusing females?” Ruth’s attorney, Mark J. Boskovich, told Page 6 when asked about Carter’s countersuit. “A jury will weigh the evidence and decide.”

      China has hit back after reports that Washington is moving to further restrict sales of American technology to Huawei. 
   
      “China is deeply concerned,” Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the country’s foreign ministry, said at a press conference Tuesday. 
   
      The Financial Times reported earlier that the US Commerce Department had notified some companies that it would no longer grant licenses for any company to export American technology to Huawei, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.
   
Bloomberg also reported, citing anonymous sources, that officials were considering cutting off Huawei from all US suppliers, though it noted that a decision had not yet been made.
   
      “We are closely following relevant developments,” Mao said. 
   
      “China firmly opposes the United States’ generalization of the concept of national security, abuse of state power, and unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies,” she told reporters, adding that such a move would “violate international economic and trade rules.”
   
      Mao vowed that Beijing would “firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.”
   
      Huawei declined to comment on the reports, while the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside US business hours.
   
      Huawei’s ties to the world’s biggest economy have already been curtailed in recent years as Washington continuously clamps down on the Chinese tech giant. 
   
      In 2019, Washington added the company to the so-called “entity list,” which restricts exports to select organizations without a US government license. The following year, the US government expanded on those curbs by seeking to cut Huawei off from chip suppliers using US-made technology.
   
      US officials have argued that Huawei poses a risk to US national security.
   
      Huawei has vehemently denied such claims, and its founder and CEO has repeatedly said the company would never hand data over to the Chinese government. Western security experts, however, have said that China’s national security and intelligence laws require Chinese companies to comply with demands for information.

Paris Saint-Germain has struggled in recent games, relatively speaking, but thankfully for the Parisian club, Lionel Messi has been in fine scoring form. 
   
      The Argentine was on target again Saturday, scoring in the second half to secure a 2-1 comeback win for PSG against Toulouse. 
   
      Victory extended PSG’s lead over Marseille, which has a game in hand, at the top of Ligue 1 to eight points, even though Christophe Galtier’s side has only won two of its last five league matches. 
   
      Branco van den Boomen opened the scoring in the 20th minute to give Toulouse an unexpected lead in Paris, but before the break Achraf Hakimi leveled. 
   
      With Neymar and Kylian Mbappé both injured, it fell on Messi to make that telling contribution for the home team. 
   
      And in the 58th minute Messi put his name on the scoresheet, curling into the bottom corner from outside the area for his 10th league goal of the season and a third in his last five league games. 
   
      The World Cup winner also came close to a second, hitting the post in stoppage time. 
   
      “Lionel was our engine, he scored and created chances. I ask of the team that they play for him,” said Galtier, per Reuters. 
   
      “His teammates need to make more efforts defensively to give him more freedom to create movement and opportunities.”

      CNN correspondent Frederik Pleitgen and his team were traveling on Thursday to the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk to report on the search and rescue efforts underway after a residential building was leveled overnight by a Russian missile. It was “supposed to be a fairly easy shoot,” Pleitgen said, given that the crew was not heading to the frontlines of the war.
   
      “But it turned bad in an instant,” Pleitgen said, describing what transpired in the blink of an eye as one of the “closest calls” and most dangerous episodes in his lengthy career as a foreign correspondent.
   
      As Pleitgen and the team were heading to the scene, just moments after they had parked and exited their vehicle, a Russian missile struck nearby without warning, sending flames and thick plumes into the air as screaming civilians scrambled to find shelter. Pleitgen estimated that it landed only 40 or 50 yards shy of them.
   
      “People went running to safety,” he said. “We made our way to the other side of the road to get into cover in a basement there. As I looked back, a second missile struck nearly the same place. Another big blast. We took cover. [We were] in a basement with some residents.”
   
      At least five people were wounded in the attack that badly damaged residential buildings, a children’s clinic and school, according to a Ukrainian official.
   
      Pleitgen said that after some time had passed, “when it stayed quiet,” the CNN team exited the basement, filmed the destruction left by the powerful blasts, and then quickly left the scene.

      The incident underscores the dangerous reporting that journalists are doing each day in Ukraine, navigating perilous situations to deliver news to the world about the toll Vladimir Putin’s aggression has taken on the Eastern European country and its people. The Committee to Protect Journalists said last week that Ukraine was the deadliest country for reporters in 2022, with 15 members of the press killed in the war-torn country.
   
      “People need to understand that this war is a whole other level of danger than wars in the past decades,” Pleitgen said, adding that this is “the most dangerous” war he has ever covered. “This a full on conventional war using heavy weapons that can hit frontline areas but also civilian places anytime.”
   
      Pleitgen said he couldn’t, for obvious reasons, detail the security precautions the CNN crew takes when operating in a war zone. But he did say that “planning and communication are everything” for the team, and that they were well prepared when the reporting assignment quickly turned dire.
   
      The incident, Pleitgen said, has impacted how he thinks about reporting from the war zone. He said, “it is so important” for journalists to be in the country reporting on the Russian invasion that has left thousands of civilians dead and forced millions to flee their homes, “even though it is very dangerous.”
   
      When asked how he feels about waking up in the morning tomorrow and heading back into the field, given the close call, Pleitgen said, “I feel confident.”
   
      “But of course, an event like this reminds you to never let your guard down,” he said.
   
      “It can all go south quickly.”

      When President Joe Biden took to the House Chamber on Tuesday for his annual State of the Union address, his message was one of unadulterated optimism – even in the face of open hostility.
   
      The spectacle of Biden smiling and offering a pointed riposte through multiple rounds of heckling from some House Republicans was, in many ways, an apt illustration of his presidency and a useful preview of his likely 2024 candidacy.
   
      A majority of Americans say he hasn’t accomplished much, many Democrats aren’t thrilled at the prospect of him running for reelection and he faces clear disdain from most Republicans. 
   
But Biden powered through. Delivering what was widely viewed as a test run for his reelection announcement, Biden claimed credit for progress made during his first two years in office while stressing the job isn’t finished. 
   
      He faced sometimes-unruly Republicans, with whom he spiritedly sparred from the podium on spending cuts. The feisty display drew cheers inside the White House and offered the best preview to date of the energy Biden hopes to bring to the campaign trail soon.
   
      The speech carried a strain of populism rooted in strengthening the middle class – vintage Biden, but delivered at a pivotal moment for his political future.
   
      No president enters his State of the Union wanting to recite a laundry list of accomplishments and proposals, but – almost inevitably – the speech often veers in that direction. Biden’s was no different, even as the president sought to tie everything together with a refrain of “finish the job” – a phrase that appeared 12 times in his prepared text.
   
      Rather than tout any one accomplishment, however, Biden hoped to address the national mood, one that remains downbeat even as the economy improves and the country attempts to return to normal amid the Covid-19 pandemic. 
   
      Here are six takeaways from Biden’s State of the Union: 
   
      In a room full of elected officials, identifying an adult shouldn’t be difficult. But heading into Tuesday’s speech, both Republican leaders and Biden’s team telegraphed a desire to act as the night’s “adult in the room” – the mature voice seeking common ground and lowering the temperature.
   
      For the first 45 minutes of Biden’s address, that appeared to be the play for both sides. But when Biden began castigating Republicans for plans that would slash Social Security and Medicare, the decorum dropped.
   
      His accusations seemed to provoke Republicans, who lobbed accusations of “liar” from their seats in the chamber.
   
      That in itself wasn’t unprecedented. What happened next was rarer: Biden leaned into the opening, responding and engaging his hecklers.
   
      “I enjoy conversion,” he quipped, suggesting they were in agreement on the need to protect the programs for senior citizens.
   
      For Biden, House Republicans act as a useful foil as he prepares to announce his intentions for 2024. His jousting on Tuesday was the best glimpse of how he’ll approach his candidacy, at least until a Republican opponent emerges from the GOP primary process.
   
      White House officials were thrilled by the off script back and forth.
   
      “Couldn’t have written a better moment,” one official said.
   
      More than the substantive back and forth, one official noted how it appeared to animate Biden in real time.
   
      “He gets energy from his audience,” the official said. It’s not a new view on how Biden operates - his advisers constantly talk about how he finds his energy from engaging with people.
   
      Biden and his team believe a serious focus on governing contrasts favorably with House Republicans, who they accuse of threatening to send the nation into default and piling up distractions as they investigate the president and his family.
   
      House Speaker Kevin McCarthy entered the speech vowing to treat Biden respectfully – and urging his Republican colleagues to do the same. It was a tall order, given the loose grasp he has on his conference and the propensity from certain Republicans for stunts.
   
      As lawmakers like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene interrupted Biden, McCarthy was silent – but his glare into the crowd spoke for itself. Later he found himself shushing his conference multiple times at outbursts interrupted the president.
   
      For the third year in a row, Biden set the record for the oldest president to deliver an address to a joint session of Congress. It’s an underlying fact of his presidency: No one older has ever served.
   
      As Biden prepares to ask voters to keep him in office until he is 86, it was critical he look and sound like someone who is able to keep doing the job. 
   
      His delivery was energetic, even if he stumbled over a few of his prepared lines. When Republicans interrupted him, he responded quickly, deftly turning their heckles back around into challenges.
   
      Over the weekend at Camp David, aides set up a podium, microphone, lights and teleprompter in a conference room inside the Laurel Lodge for Biden to practice his speech with his team. The potential for hecklers was something White House officials had in mind as they prepared for the speech.
   
      At the White House, a similar set up has been used in the Map Room to practice the address.
   
      Aides were focused on the message – but also the language, ensuring the speech lent itself to a vigorous presentation. After all, for many in Biden’s television audience, Tuesday’s speech was one of the only times they actually heard and saw the president this year.
   
      Perhaps more than his previous two addresses to Congress, Tuesday’s speech was salted with riffs and lines that appear nearly every time he speaks: inherited wisdoms from his father, anecdotes about inequality and his views of the middle class.
   
      “So many of you feel like you’ve just been forgotten,” he said, directly appealing to a demographic that used to vote reliably for Democrats but has more recently turned to the GOP.
   
      “Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible. Maybe that’s you, watching at home,” he said. “You wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.”
   
      “I get that,” he said.
   
      Appearing for the first time in front of a divided Congress, Biden also leaned into his record working across the aisle – even as he faced heckling from Republicans.
   
      In many ways, both Biden and McCarthy hoped a more mature showing would set the tone for the next two years of divided government, even if they remain sharply divided on policy.
   
      “Mr. Speaker, I don’t want to ruin your reputation but I look forward to working together,” Biden said as he launched into his speech.
   
      He acknowledged that over the first years of his presidency “we disagreed plenty.” But he appealed to his political rivals for cooperation. 
   
      “To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this Congress as well,” he said.
   
      If there is one political conundrum Biden’s advisers are urgently working to solve, it is why so many Americans seem to believe he has accomplished so little. By all accounts, Biden has passed large, historic pieces of legislation that could have transformational effects on the US economy. But polls show large majorities aren’t feeling them.
   
      Biden hoped in his speech to bridge that gap, to demonstrate he cares about what Americans care about and to identify the problems he’s looking to fix.
   
      His focus on highly specific issues – like eliminating “junk fees” for consumers or reining in tech companies – are areas the White House believes will resonate with Americans who aren’t necessarily attuned to the ins-and-outs of Washington.
   
      At moments, his speech seemed tailor-made for a nation of annoyed consumers, down to annoyances about baggage fees on airlines and fine print on hotel bills.
   
      “Americans are tired of being played for suckers,” he said, listing off the litany of common grievances.
   
      But Biden and his team are acutely aware that simply telling people their lives are improving won’t cut it – they have to actually feel it. Many of the accomplishments Biden helped passed over the past two years are still in the implementation phase, making their effects elusive for now.
   
      Biden seemed to acknowledge that when he urged lawmakers to extend a price cap on insulin – a benefit that is still coming into effect.
   
      The furious Republican backlash to Biden’s handling of a suspected Chinese spy balloon proved illustrative for many at the White House. 
   
      China was included in the text of Biden’s speech well before the balloon slipped into American airspace. But the incursion, which has generated a diplomatic backlash from China and drawn second-guessing from Republicans, lent new urgency to Biden’s message about competing with Beijing.
   
      “Make no mistake: As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did,” Biden said in his speech.
   
      Biden and his aides believe steps to counter China are one of the rare areas where he could find bipartisan support. He saw some success on that front with the passage of a law boosting US semiconductor production last year.
   
      Biden is sensitive to accusations he is weak on China, according to people around him, while still intent on stabilizing the world’s most important bilateral relationship.
   
      The GOP’s choice to deliver their response to Biden’s speech, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is – at 40 years old – the nation’s youngest governor. Half the president’s age, her selection was a clear choice to contrast a different generation of leaders.
   
      In part because she lacked an audience and in part because Biden was energetically provoked by Republicans in his own address, her speech was a far more staid affair than the State of the Union. Delivered solemnly from the governor’s mansion in Little Rock, the speech was instead a somewhat dark warning against Democratic policies she deemed “crazy,” a descriptor she used three times.
   
      “The dividing line in America is no longer between right or left,” she said. “The choice is between normal or crazy.”
   
      She accused the Biden administration of appearing “more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day” and leaned heavily on culture war issues that she claimed her party “didn’t start and never wanted to fight.”
   
      And while she cited her tenure as White House press secretary to Donald Trump, she did not rely heavily on her association with the former president.
   
      Instead, she appeared to call for a changing of the guard – an appeal for generational change that could apply as much to Democrats and Biden as it could to Republicans and Trump.
   
      “It’s time for a new generation to lead. This is our moment. This is our opportunity,” she said.

      The last time Questlove and Will Smith were on the same stage it was controversial, but anyone looking for Smith in the hip-hop tribute produced by Questlove at the Sunday’s Grammy Awards would have been disappointed.
   
      Questlove explained to Variety in advance of the broadcast that Smith had planned to participate in the 50th anniversary celebration of the genre, which included some of the biggest legends in hip hop, but he had a scheduling conflict.
   
      “I’ll give the spoiler alert away. Will Smith was a part of the festivities tonight, but they started shooting ‘Bad Boys 4’ this week,” Questlove said. “There were a lot of preliminary shots that he had to do, so we had to lose Will.”
   
      Before he became an actor, Smith was a rapper whose iconic 1991 hit “Summertime” has become an anthem the season.
   
      He and co-star Martin Lawrence announced last week that they were beginning work on the “Bad Boys” sequel.
   
      Smith famously stormed the stage during last year’s Oscars telecast and slapped Chris Rock after Rock made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. After the slap Rock presented Questlove with the for best documentary feature Academy Award for the film “Summer of Soul.”

      On Monday, the US State Department’s domestic offices, bureaus and posts overseas will begin communicating in a style that’s unlike any other they’ve ever used before: The agency will ditch Times New Roman, a font it has been using since February 2004, and switch to the plainer Calibri.
   
      Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s email about the change was titled “The Times (New Roman) are a-Changin,” according to the Washington Post.  
   
      The new typeface came recommended by internal diversity and disability groups. There has been a growing movement to make webpages and publications more accessible, including with fonts that are easier to read for people with dyslexia or those with aging eyes.
   
      An agency spokesperson said in an email to CNN that “The Department is committed to creating a more accessible workplace and being a public sector leader in modeling accessibility best practices.”
   
      Design-wise, Times New Roman is the fussier font. Calibri is what’s known as a sans serif font, meaning it does not have little flourishes known as “wings” and “feet” on each letter like Times New Roman does. These decorative, angular serifs can create accessibility issues for some readers, experts say.
   
      Times New Roman can be difficult for people with a visual impairment, dyslexia or learning differences who use Screen Reader or Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology for help reading printed material. OCR that uses character recognition to identify the shapes of digits, letters and other characters, converting a scanned image into an electronic format that can be searched. 
   
      “I think one of the strengths has been that Calibri is perceived that it’s a good strong font on a screen, as well as printed clarity,” said Dr. Sarah Lewthwaite, a senior research fellow at the University of Southampton who works on font and accessibility research. “One of the big things about accessibility is trying to remove barriers to make any resource or services as accommodating as possible to the largest number of people.”
   
      Additionally, Calibri offers a wider range of characters, so it works well with other languages, Lewthwaite said. 
   
      Times New Roman can cause some visual recognition issues for people with learning disabilities. Visual acuity also declines with age, and the clarity of a sans serif typeface can make reading easier, Lewthwaite said.
   
      When we read, we don’t just focus on a word. We look ahead toward the next word, and the next. Sometimes, a reader will recognize shapes rather than reading every single part of the word, and they skip forward through the text. 
   
      “Typeface is important to readability, which is how easy your text is to read,” Lewthwaite said.
   
      Reading involves a collaboration between those areas of the brain that support language and those areas of the visual system that allow the brain to recognize objects, explains Dr. Guinevere Eden, a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, whose areas of study include the neural bases for reading. The brain actually repurposes the neurons involved in object recognition for letter and word recognition, she said. 
   
      The visual clutter of fonts with wings and feet like Times New Roman can trip a reader up and get in the way.
   
      “Fonts that are busy, perhaps they induce crowding, and that can be a problem in terms of accessing that print,” Eden said.
   
      Crowding is a phenomenon in which the recognition of objects – in this case letters – is impaired by the presence of neighboring objects so the reader perceives details with less clarity. 
   
      If a font is sharp enough, standing out from its background, the contrast can especially help people who have a visual impairment. More space between letters, lines and words can also help a font be readable, but there is the practical reality that people in the State Department value brevity, and adding too much space to a page may not be practical.
   
      Lewthwaite noted that it can be difficult to distinguish between the capital letter “I” and the lowercase “l” with Calibri, and punctuation is small. 
   
      It’s also important to keep in mind that sans serif fonts like Calibri may not increase reading speed or comprehension, Eden said, and fonts don’t necessarily enable people with dyslexia to become skilled readers. 
   
      “As long as you’re not making it less accessible to anybody, you have nothing to lose, and even if a small fraction of the population benefits from it, it’s worth doing,” she said.
   
      Lewthwaite added that a more accessible font can benefit everyone, whether you’re writing to your grandmother or a colleague. 
   
      “This is about all of us,” she said. 
   
      The State Department says that even something as simple as a change in font can be a matter of diplomacy and send an important signal to the world.
   
      “The new font change will make the Department’s written products and communications more accessible. It demonstrates Secretary Blinken’s allyship to those with disabilities and underscores his support for employees with disabilities,” the spokesperson said in its email to CNN. “Moreover, this change underscores that the values and message of disability inclusion are not restricted to any given month or period, but something that should be pursued all year round.”

      It was a big enough surprise that a jazz singer won best new artist at Sunday’s Grammy Awards, but that it was Samara Joy was a delight for many.
   
      The 23-year-old artist from the Bronx also won best jazz vocal album for her project, “Linger Awhile.” 
   
      Joy has had quite the ride to success.
   
      The singer comes from a legacy of music.
   
      Her paternal grandparents, Elder Goldwire and Ruth McLendon, sang in the famed soul gospel Philadelphia group, The Savettes. 
   
      Joy’s father is Antonio McLendon, a singer and bassist who toured for years with another gospel star, Andraé Crouch. 
   
      Like any member of Gen Z, Joy understands the power of social media.
   
      Her videos on TikTok have frequently gone viral because of her smooth stylings of both her music and some of the classics. She celebrated with a TikTok video in December when she caught the attention of premiere producer Timberland, who then posted about her on hs Instagram account. 
   
      A viral Facebook video of Joy singng Ella Fitzgerald’s “Take Love Easy” as a thank you for receiving the Ella Fitzgerald Scholarship in 2020 while a student at State University of New York at Purchase led to a record deal. 
   
      Her sound has attracted the likes of actors LaKeith Stanfield and Regina King, the latter of whom credits Joy’s music with helping her get through the pandemic.
   
      “I discovered a young woman who just seems like Sarah Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald are both living in her body,” King said during a directors roundtable two years ago for The Hollywood Reporter. “When I watch her and listen to her… her name is Samara Joy and it brings me joy.”
   
      While she’s been compared to plenty of the jazz greats, including Sarah Vaughn, Joy has named someone closer to her own age as her inspiration.
   
According to a 2019 interview with then WBGO radio host Keanna Faircloth, the young singer admires 31-year-old Jazzmeia Horn.
   
      “For Samara, Horn’s presence and ability to use the stage are characteristics that she aspires to,” the WBGO article stated. 
   
      The then 20-year-old Joy won the prestigious Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Competition in 2019 and things took off from there.

      In the HBO show “The Last of Us,” characters identify zombies among them by the fungi that bursts from their bodies, and fungal parasites manipulate the humans to infect the communities around them. 
   
      In real life, the fungal species that inspired the story, Ophiocordyceps, infects insects and does not cause problems for people. HBO, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.
   
      However, the threat from fungal pathogens is increasing, experts say, and may grow much worse in a warmer, wetter and sicker world. 
   
      “We’re always surrounded by fungal spores. We’ve lived with them ever since we made beds in the Savanna 500,000 years ago, before we even evolved into modern humans. And we’ve had to adapt this exquisite immune system that we have to defend against spores, because many of them are potentially pathogenic,” said Dr. Matthew Fisher, a professor of medicine in the School of Public Health at Imperial College London whose research focuses on emerging pathogenic fungi.
   
      “Fungi are just seeking sources of food, and in the eyes of many saprotropic fungi, we are just food,” he added. (Saprotrophic describes an organism that feeds on dead organic matter.)
   
      Many millions of fungi are good for the environment, but a few hundred can cause disease in humans. 
   
      Scientists are finding new fungi all the time – they found four just last year – but not all of them are a threat to humans. 
   
      Of the 4 million or so diverse fungal species, scientists have identified only 300 as human pathogens that can cause disease. 
   
      In any given year, more than a billion people have what the Microbiology Society considers “superficial” fungal infections.
   
Athlete’s foot, a scaly rash that can cause itching or stinging; thrush, white lesions that develop on the tongue or inner cheek; and even dandruff are largely caused by one of these superficial fungal infections. They are irritating, but fortunately, treatments still work on them. 
   
      Some infections can be much more serious, even life-threatening. 
   
      Globally, about 1.5 million people die from them each year, with few working treatments available, if any, according to the Microbiology Society. 
   
      Last year, the World Health Organization said that it considers fungal pathogens a “major threat” to public health and, for the first time, released its prioritized list of the 19 kinds the world should watch out for. 
   
      One of the four on WHO’s list of the most critical species is cryptococcus neoformans, a pathogenic yeast that lives in the soil. People can inhale fungal cells, and most don’t get sick. But in those with a suppressed immune system, it can affect the lungs and spread to the nervous system and blood. Over the years, this fungus has become resistant to some treatments.
   
      Another is Candida auris, a yeast that can linger on surfaces and medical equipment and can spread quickly from one person to another. It has caused a growing number of hospital outbreaks around the world, a threat that grew larger still during the Covid-19 pandemic. The CDC says that may in part be due to changes in routine infection-control practices. Infection can affect the heart, central nervous system, eyes, bones and internal organs. It is resistant to many classes of antifungal treatments but can sometimes be treated with antifungal medicines called echinocandins.
   
Apergillus fumigatus, a mold that can be found just about everywhere, may cause pulmonary disease in people with weakened immune systems. It could also cause allergic reactions or lung infections that might become serious and move to other organs. It has showed growing antifungal resistance, WHO says, thanks to widespread use of azole fungicides to prevent its spread in crops.
   
      The fourth pathogen, Candida albicans, is another yeast that typically is a part of a healthy human microbiome. It lives in the mouth, intestines and skin. Bacteria in your body keep it in check, but if the system is off-balance, the yeast will overgrow and turn into a vaginal yeast infection, diaper rash, thrush or another condition. It can also become a severe infection that targets the blood, heart, central nervous system, eyes, bones and internal organs.
 
      There are no vaccines for any of the four fungal infections on the critical list.
   
      Fisher said our bodies are generally pretty good at protecting against fungal infections, but “chinks open up in our immune system.”
   
      “Then we can have fatal consequences,” he said. 
   
      People who are most at risk of a serious fungal infection are those with underlying conditions like HIV, cancer or diabetes and those with compromised immune systems because of their age, a disease or the drugs they take. 
   
      Others are vulnerable to the more severe consequences of fungal infections because they don’t have access to medicines more commonly available in the West. For instance, cryptococcal meningitis is a leading cause of death for people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa because they don’t have access to treatments, studies have found.
   
      The number of serious fungal infections has increased partly because of the growing number of immune-suppressed people, studies show. 
 
      “What’s changing is that more people that are exposed have those high risk factors. We have aging populations, and we were using a lot of chemicals in the environment which are forcing fungi to adapt, and our clinical antifungals are being degraded by antimicrobial resistance,” Fisher said.
   
      There have also been more opportunistic fungal infections during the Covid-19 pandemic, just like there have been after flu epidemics, said Dr. Matthew Kasson, a mycologist at West Virginia University.
 
      “Viruses have this way of suppressing the immune response, and some of the drugs we’re using to combat the viruses are also having an effect where they’re making it easier for fungi to invade,” he said.
   
A black fungus killed thousands of people in India in 2021, and 85% of them were Covid-19 patients.
   
      Fisher said some fungi also seem to “appear out of nowhere” and “are quite quietly spreading around the world, causing silent pandemics,” such as Candida auris.
   
      Additionally, the climate crisis has exacerbated the spread of fungal infections.
   
      “The world is becoming warmer and wetter. That’s just going to mean that there’s a higher burden of mold spores,” Fisher said. 
   
      WHO encourages countries to improve their diagnostic capacity for fungal infections and to increase surveillance. It also recommends more money put into research, medicine and tests for these infections. Currently, fungal infections receive less than 1.5% of all infectious disease research funding, WHO said.
   
      It’s difficult to develop antifungal treatments because, in the words of Dr. Matt Nelsen, a researcher from Chicago’s Field Museum, “animals and fungi are each other’s closest relatives.”
   
      “We share a lot of biochemical similarities, and so when we are trying to kill off the fungus, we need to be careful that we’re not also killing ourselves,” he said.
   
      One of the best defenses against fungal infections is to keep your immune system strong.
   
      Fisher advises parents to let children play outside a lot so they will get exposed to a good range of fungi to help develop a healthy immune system. Homes should also be well-ventilated and moisture-free. 
   
      Kasson said he thinks the attention from “The Last of Us” and other programs means “fungi are having a moment,” yet he hopes it is not going to be overblown.
   
      When the movie “Jaws” came out, it led to an increase in shark hunting. In fact, sharks were almost hunted to extinction. 
   
      Millions of fungi are good, Kasson points out. They break down wood, and they can be used in food and in human medicine.
   
      “Fungal infections, yes, are a serious concern, and I think it’s going to get worse unless we start to really appreciate those connections between how we manage crops, how we manage human disease, how we manage wildlife disease. They’re all interconnected,” he said. “The sooner we realize that, I think, the sooner we can come up with solutions that help all involved.”

LeBron James admits he is “definitely disappointed” that the Los Angeles Lakers were unable to acquire Kyrie Irving in a trade, with the former Brooklyn Nets guard instead being dealt to the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday.
   
James and Irving previously enjoyed great success playing together at the Cleveland Cavaliers between 2014 and 2017, reaching the NBA Finals in all three of the seasons they were teammates and winning the title in 2016.
   
      “I can’t sit here and say I’m not disappointed on not being able to land such a talent,” James told ESPN on Monday. “But [also] someone that I had great chemistry with and know I got great chemistry with on the floor, that can help you win championships, in my mind, in my eyes.
   
      “But my focus is shifted now. My focus is shifted back to where it should be and that’s this club now and what we have in the locker room.”
   
      The Lakers have endured a torrid season so far, racking up another defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday as the team languishes in 13th in the Western Conference.
   
      The ‘Big Three’ of James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook was supposed to signal the start of another title challenge, but the trio have consistently struggled together with Westbrook being relegated to a bench role this season.
   
      However, despite Saturday’s defeat, an unusually bunched up Western Conference means the Lakers are still only 1.5 games back from the play-in and 3.5 games back from an automatic playoff spot.
   
      James remains bullish on his team’s chances in the postseason and insists he is now completely focused on the Lakers’ current roster following Irving’s trade to the Mavericks.
   
      “It’s a quick pivot,” James said. “It don’t take me long. I don’t get too excited about the possibilities of things that can be. 
   
      “I kind of envision myself on what it can, but I don’t invest it all the way into it until I know it’s happening and when it does not happen, I’m back locked in on the job at hand.
   
      “So we had an opportunity, our names were out there, the Lakers name was out there. We had an opportunity, it didn’t happen. We move on and we finish this season strong, try to get a bid into the postseason, where I feel if we go in healthy, we can compete with anybody.”
   
      Even though the Lakers have struggled, James has been playing some of the best basketball of his career as he closes in on the NBA’s all-time scoring record.
   
      James is just 36 points behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s total of 38, 387 and has the chance to break the record either on Tuesday at home to the Oklahoma City Thunder or Thursday at home to the Milwaukee Bucks.
   
      Abdul-Jabbar has held the top spot since he surpassed Wilt Chamberlain in 1984, setting the current total during his final NBA season in 1989.
   
      “It’s still mind-boggling to myself,” James said of his imminent accomplishment. “Because I’ve set goals throughout my whole career. I wanted to be Rookie of the Year, I wanted to be an MVP in this league, I wanted to win championships, be an All-Star, I wanted to lead the league in assists, make all defensive team, Defensive Player of the Year.
   
      “I’ve never said I wanted to lead the league in scoring or, for sure, never said I wanted to be the all-time leader in scoring. That’s never been a dream of mine and to sit here and actually be on the brink of it happening, it’s pretty crazy.”

      The last time Questlove and Will Smith were on the same stage it was controversial, but anyone looking for Smith in the hip-hop tribute produced by Questlove at the Sunday’s Grammy Awards would have been disappointed.
   
      Questlove explained to Variety in advance of the broadcast that Smith had planned to participate in the 50th anniversary celebration of the genre, which included some of the biggest legends in hip hop, but he had a scheduling conflict.
   
      “I’ll give the spoiler alert away. Will Smith was a part of the festivities tonight, but they started shooting ‘Bad Boys 4’ this week,” Questlove said. “There were a lot of preliminary shots that he had to do, so we had to lose Will.”
   
      Before he became an actor, Smith was a rapper whose iconic 1991 hit “Summertime” has become an anthem the season.
   
      He and co-star Martin Lawrence announced last week that they were beginning work on the “Bad Boys” sequel.
   
      Smith famously stormed the stage during last year’s Oscars telecast and slapped Chris Rock after Rock made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. After the slap Rock presented Questlove with the for best documentary feature Academy Award for the film “Summer of Soul.”

      It was a big enough surprise that a jazz singer won best new artist at Sunday’s Grammy Awards, but that it was Samara Joy was a delight for many.
   
      The 23-year-old artist from the Bronx also won best jazz vocal album for her project, “Linger Awhile.” 
   
      Joy has had quite the ride to success.
   
      The singer comes from a legacy of music.
   
      Her paternal grandparents, Elder Goldwire and Ruth McLendon, sang in the famed soul gospel Philadelphia group, The Savettes. 
   
      Joy’s father is Antonio McLendon, a singer and bassist who toured for years with another gospel star, Andraé Crouch. 
   
      Like any member of Gen Z, Joy understands the power of social media.
   
      Her videos on TikTok have frequently gone viral because of her smooth stylings of both her music and some of the classics. She celebrated with a TikTok video in December when she caught the attention of premiere producer Timberland, who then posted about her on hs Instagram account. 
   
      A viral Facebook video of Joy singng Ella Fitzgerald’s “Take Love Easy” as a thank you for receiving the Ella Fitzgerald Scholarship in 2020 while a student at State University of New York at Purchase led to a record deal. 
   
      Her sound has attracted the likes of actors LaKeith Stanfield and Regina King, the latter of whom credits Joy’s music with helping her get through the pandemic.
   
      “I discovered a young woman who just seems like Sarah Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald are both living in her body,” King said during a directors roundtable two years ago for The Hollywood Reporter. “When I watch her and listen to her… her name is Samara Joy and it brings me joy.”
   
      While she’s been compared to plenty of the jazz greats, including Sarah Vaughn, Joy has named someone closer to her own age as her inspiration.
   
According to a 2019 interview with then WBGO radio host Keanna Faircloth, the young singer admires 31-year-old Jazzmeia Horn.
   
      “For Samara, Horn’s presence and ability to use the stage are characteristics that she aspires to,” the WBGO article stated. 
   
      The then 20-year-old Joy won the prestigious Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Competition in 2019 and things took off from there.

      In the days since the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria and Turkey, the death toll, now at more than 23,000, is climbing, and stories of survival are becoming few and far between. 
   
      A lucky few are still being pulled alive from the rubble: two teenage sisters were rescued from debris in Kahramanmaraş city 101 hours after the massive earthquake hit Turkey. 
   
      Ayfer, 15, was rescued in the 99th hour after the quake, as rescuers calmed her by playing her music and promising her ice cream. Her sister, Fatma, 13, was saved two hours later in a 10-hour rescue operation after seismic sensors detected signs of life under the debris.
   
      And on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, five days – approximately 102 hours – after the 7.8-magnitude quake struck, rescue workers managed to pull out a family of six, including two parents and their four children, from their collapsed first floor home in the city of Iskenderun.
   
      But more than four days on, and as temperatures plummet in both countries, hopes of finding loved ones are dimming, and the reality of grief and shock is setting in for the thousands left displaced across both countries.  
   
      Although they could be considered the lucky ones, a grim reality is setting in for those left alive.
   
      Survivors could face “a secondary disaster” as cold and snow lead to “worsening and horrific conditions,” the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned Thursday, as affected areas in both countries face colder than normal temperatures. For example, the Syrian city of Aleppo is forecast to have lows of -3°C to -2°C (27°F to 28°F) through this weekend, whereas February lows are normally 2.5°C (36°F).
   
      Speaking at a press conference in Geneva, WHO incident response manager Robert Holden warned there were “a lot of people” surviving “out in the open, in worsening and horrific conditions.”
   
      “We’ve got major disruptions to basic water supplies, we’ve got major disruption to fuel, electricity supplies, communication supplies, the basics of life,” Holden said.
   
      “We are in real danger of seeing a secondary disaster which may cause harm to more people than the initial disaster if we don’t move with the same pace and intensity as we are doing on the search and rescue side,” Holden added.
   
      In Syria, the earthquake’s devastation is heaping misery on top of an existing humanitarian crisis resulting from a more than decade-long civil war.  
   
      The delivery of urgent supplies to the country’s quake-hit northern areas has been complicated by a long-running civil war between opposition forces and the Syrian government, led by President Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of killing his own people.
   
      Many Western nations have refused to send aid directly to the Syrian regime, which is under US and EU sanctions, and Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad says any aid it receives must go through the capital Damascus, leaving rebel-held areas reliant on aid groups including the UN.
   
      Millions living in northwest Syria, much of which is controlled by anti-government rebels, were already suffering from the effects of extreme poverty and a cholera outbreak when the quake hit. Now, they are left fending for themselves, with the first UN aid convoy from Turkey into northwestern Syria arriving Thursday, days after the initial quake, followed by a second on Friday, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  
   
      In the past aid was brought into northwest Syria through Turkey from Bab al-Hawa crossing – the only point of entry authorized by the UN Security Council. A resolution proposing more border openings between Turkey and Syria was vetoed by Russia and China.
   
      The other path in was through “crosslines,” aid coming in from Syrian government territory into the rebel-held northwest.
   
      The World Food Programme (WFP) is calling for more access to Syrian territories impacted to replenish aid supplies that have been exhausted, with the organization’s executive director calling the situation in the northwest of the country “catastrophe on top of catastrophe.”
   
      “The one crossing authorized by the Security Council has been re-opened, but damage to roads and slowed customs clearances are significantly hampering movement,” World Food Programme executive director David Beasley told CNN.
   
      “What stocks we have are being exhausted quickly, especially the ready to eat rations, and they need to be replenished quickly. To do this, we need access,” Beasley added.

      Former Vice President Mike Pence is expected to fight a recent subpoena from the special counsel investigating former President Donald Trump’s post-2020 election activities based on the grounds that he was president of the Senate at the time and therefore shielded from the order, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. 
   
Pence is expected to address the subpoena and his response to it during a trip to Iowa on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with his plans. His decision to fight the subpoena comes as the former vice president is mulling a 2024 presidential bid.  
   
      Pence has been subpoenaed by Jack Smith, the special counsel investigating Trump and his role in January 6, 2021, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Smith’s office is seeking documents and testimony, the source said. Investigators want the former vice president to testify about his interactions with Trump leading up to the 2020 election and the day of the attack on the US Capitol.
   
      Pence’s decision to fight the subpoena is likely to drag out his legal entanglements, something that many advisers had hoped would be cleared up by the time he announced his likely bid for president. 
   
      However, the move could allow for Pence to avoid the optics of willingly participating in an investigation into his former boss at the hands of the Department of Justice, which Republicans have sought to paint as politicized.
   
      The decision could also help the former vice president avoid being pitted against Trump once again, after a lawyer for the former president confirmed Sunday that Trump intends to assert executive privilege in an effort to limit any Pence testimony, a source close to Pence noted. Pence has often worked to downplay the tension between he and the former president as he inches towards a presidential run against his former boss, including largely defending Trump and touting the administration’s achievements in his new memoir. 
   
      Pence’s team, according to a source, had previously indicated to the Justice Department that he’d be open to answering questions if they were limited to the matters he had previously discussed publicly, including in his book.
   
      The subpoena marks an important milestone in the Justice Department’s two-year criminal investigation, now led by the special counsel, into the efforts by Trump and allies to impede the transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election. Pence is an important witness who has detailed in a memoir some of his interactions with Trump in the weeks after the election, a move that likely opens the door for the Justice Department to override at least some of Trump’s claims of executive privilege.
   
      Pence’s intentions to resist the subpoena were first reported by Politico.
 
      The prospect of Pence fighting the special counsel’s subpoena in court comes as several other witnesses in the Justice Department’s investigations encircling Trump are already in secret legal battles over DOJ’s demands for information from them. Those legal battles have played out under seal, keeping out of view the details of what exactly the department is seeking from members of Trump’s inner circle and what arguments are being made for withholding that information. It is unclear how much will be made publicly known about the circumstances of Pence’s dispute with the special counsel over the subpoena – beyond the response Pence is expected to issue Tuesday. 
   
      Pence is expected to make arguments raising the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause, according to a source. The clause protects legislators from certain law enforcement actions if the conduct in question is related to their legislative duties. Lawmakers have tried to use the Speech or Debate Clause to resist participating in the House investigation into the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. Sen. Lindsey Graham also invoked the clause to challenge a subpoena in the Fulton County, Atlanta, investigation into 2020 election meddling, but the South Carolina Republican was ultimately ordered by courts to appear for testimony in that probe. Among the sealed proceedings related to the Justice Department’s investigations is a secret dispute with Rep. Scott Perry, concerning information DOJ is seeking from the Pennsylvania Republican’s phone, where Perry is also raising Speech or Debate Clause claims. That case is currently before the DC Circuit US Court of Appeals.

      In spite of the fact that “Batgirl” won’t be seen by audiences, titular star Leslie Grace says she is proud of the movie and cautiously optimistic about the character’s future.
   
      When the news broke last summer that the DC comic book film for HBO Max was being indefinitely shelved, shocking moviegoers and industry insiders alike, Grace revealed in a new interview with Variety published on Monday that she learned of the development like everyone else – from reading it in the media. (CNN, HBO Max and DC are all part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)
   
      “It was like deflating a balloon,” Grace said, adding that on the day she learned the news, “I was very much just taking it all in, but also so sure of the magic that happened – in my experience and what I saw in my cast, in our team.”
   
      “I just really leaned on the beauty of the idea that I got to have this experience in my life,” she said. “Even though I would’ve loved to share that with the rest of the world, nothing can take that experience away from us.”
   
      Grace said she and her team continue discussing plans for the future of the property. 
   
      “We were so excited about all the ideas that we had, because you can see long-term potential in the story that we were beginning to build,” she added.
   
      Grace, who identifies as Afro-Latina, also expressed her desire for fans who were hoping to see her iteration of the superheroine not to be discouraged. 
   
      “Just keep going no matter what the obstacle is,” she said. “If you have a passion for something, don’t let anything that stands in your way tell you that you aren’t worthy, capable, or have the potential to fulfill what you know you’re capable of doing.”
   
      Last August, a Warner Bros. spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that “the decision to not release ‘Batgirl’ reflects our leadership’s strategic shift as it relates to the DC universe and HBO Max.”
   
      “Batgirl,” which had completed production and a rough cut that was shown in test screenings, was also to have starred Michael Keaton as Batman, J.K. Simmons and Brendan Fraser. 
   
      And while Grace acknowledged that the shoot had its fair share of hurdles, she insisted that “the film that I got to see – the scenes that were there – was incredible. There was definitely potential for a good film.”
   
      CNN has reached out to both Grace’s team and Warner Bros. Films for comment.
   
      The announcement of “Batgirl’s” fate came shortly after WarnerMedia’s merger with Discovery Inc. last April, and amid Warner Bros. Discovery efforts to cut costs.
   
      Grace mentioned that while Warner Bros. executives she had met with after the movie was shelved “weren’t really specific on anything creative” about the film, “when words are expressed very lightly about work that people really dedicated a lot of time to – not just myself but the whole crew – I can understand how it could be frustrating.”
   
      A few months after the decision not to release “Batgirl,” James Gunn and Peter Safran were appointed co-CEOs of DC Studios. 
   
      The duo then began charting a new path for the studio, making more news-breaking decisions in the process. First, there were reports about the “Wonder Woman” franchise, the third installment of which director Patty Jenkins said remains in development but with an uncertain fate, and in December, Henry Cavill announced that his iteration of Superman would not be moving forward in any new films. 
   
      Gunn said at the time that choices for the DC Universe will be “based upon what we believe is best for the story.”
   
      “Perhaps these choices are great, perhaps not, but they are made with sincere hearts & integrity & always with the story in mind,” he tweeted last December.

      A sports-obsessive named Happy Gilmore wins a long-drive contest and proceeds to chase a career in professional golf.
   
      You might recognize that plot synopsis from Adam Sandler’s 1996 comedy, named for its protagonist, which has become a cult classic among golf and film fans alike.
   
      But this plot also tells the very real story of a young Indiana golfer.
   
      While his neurotic fictional namesake – who brawled both an alligator and TV host Bob Barker – quite literally fought his way to the PGA Tour Championship, the 17-year-old real-life Happy Gilmore is carving a calmer path towards the Tour.
   
      “I’d say I’ve got a little bit better anger management,” Gilmore told CNN. “I haven’t punched anybody or broken any rakes recently.”
   
      Born Landon Gilmore and gifted a set of golf clubs on his first birthday, the potential for life to imitate art was a possibility long before he played his first event around the age of six, the Little People’s Golf Championship in Quincy, Illinois. 
   
      But after winning the tournament’s long-drive event, he was given the nickname “Happy” and Gilmore’s fate was sealed. By the time he was 12, Happy was, for all intents and purposes, his official title. 
   
      These days, it is rare for the Bloomington High School sophomore to hear his birth name, with many classmates and teachers unaware he was ever known as anything else.

      A regular face on the state’s junior golf circuit, the presence of the name Happy Gilmore on event leaderboards inevitably raises eyebrows among organizers and competitors alike. 
   
      “They’ll think it’s funny or they’ll think it’s a joke,” Gilmore said. “Then I’ll point and say, ‘Look, my name’s on the bag. I’m not joking with you.”
   
      “You suck, ya jackass!”
   
      It’s the favorite barb of a particularly effective heckler in the movie,  but the real-life Gilmore has never heard anything nearly as bad at the tee.
   
      While no stranger to the occasional shout from the crowd, the junior golfer is yet to experience anything other than light-hearted jibes at events. His personal favorite came during his freshman year when Gilmore, uncharacteristically nervous at a state tournament, heard after his opening tee shot: “Go get em’ Shooter!” a nod to the film’s lead villain, Shooter McGavin.
 
      Unlike his movie counterpart, Gilmore does not have a golfing nemesis, but the friendly jeer was equally motivating.
   
      “It made me laugh and helped me get a little at ease,” Gilmore recalled. “I hear stuff like that all the time.”
   
      nd yes, he can recreate the movie’s iconic swing – which involves a long run up to the tee.
   
      When he was younger, he would practice it for fun. Nowadays though, he is asked so frequently to prove he can replicate his namesake’s technique that he works on it out of necessity.
   
      Yet bar the swing and the name, Gilmore is hard-pressed to find many other similarities between himself and Sandler’s character. In fact, he believes he is pretty much the opposite – on and off the green.
   
      “If I’ve ever been mad at something, I can just go play golf by myself and relax,” he said.
   
      “I’d like to think I’m a better putter than he is. We both can’t skate that well in hockey though, we do have that (in common).”
   
      Meeting Sandler would be a dream, but Gilmore has one aspiration that has long taken precedence above all others – to make it pro.
   
      Starting on the US Kids Tour, often decked out in the bright orange colors favored by his idol Rickie Fowler, Gilmore has played on the Hurricane Junior Golf Tour (HJGT) and GolfWeek Junior Tours in recent years. 
   
      Crowned the National Hurricane Player of the Year in 2020, he has picked up more accolades during his high school career, making the Indiana All-State team for the second successive year in his sophomore season. 
   
      In July, he will tee off at Torrey Pines having qualified for the IMG Academy Junior World Golf Championships, but the most eagerly anticipated event on his calendar will come in April, when Gilmore will try once more to qualify for the US Open.
   
      When Gilmore attempted qualification for the first time in May 2022, playing close to home at Old Oakland Country Club, in Indianapolis, he believes he was the youngest of the 84-strong field battling it out for just five spots. 
   
      Every year, thousands of golfers compete at qualifying tournaments across the country to try to make it to the major.
   
      A nightmare start saw Gilmore open with a double bogey, but after four straight pars, he arrived at the 6th hole feeling settled. Then, disaster struck.
   
      Ball one: “The worst shot” of his life, skews out of bounds. Ball two: Looks perfect, but never found, back to tee. Ball three: Smacks overhanging branch and drops into the water. 
   
      Onto his fourth ball and still at the tee box, with any hopes of qualification all but extinguished, his lifelong friend and caddie was on hand with a reference from another 1996 classic golf movie, “Tin Cup,” that broke the tension.
   
      “He looked at me and he just goes, ‘Boy, when you go down, you go down in flames,’” recalled Gilmore, who eventually tapped in for 10.
   
      “I remember I was still laughing on the green.”
   
      A rejuvenated Gilmore shot 3-under across the remainder of the event to finish 8-over 80, tied 50th and 11 shots short of the highest-scoring qualifier.

      With the experience under his belt, he is feeling confident ahead of his second attempt. 
   
      “When you’re going into it for the first time, it’s weird because you don’t know how the setup is going to be, you don’t know how people act, you really don’t know anything that’s going on besides the golf part,” he said.
   
      “This year, without having any of that new, I’ll be more comfortable. I think I have a pretty good shot at it.”

      The students responsible for a racist video – which surfaced on social media earlier this month showing one girl spray painting another girl’s face black while making racist comments – are no longer enrolled at the high school, according to a statement from the school.
   
      “The young women who (sic) responsible for this situation have been identified and they are no longer members of this school community,” Saint Hubert Catholic High School For Girls wrote in a statement published Saturday. The decision was made following an investigation into the incident, according to the statement.
   
      In the video, a girl is seen spray painting the face of another girl black as she says, “You’re a Black girl! You know your roots! It’s February! You’re nothing but a slave … and after this, she’s doing my laundry.” People in the video can be heard laughing as this occurs. One person is seen filming the incident on her phone. The girl who had her face painted black says, “I’m Black and I’m proud.”
   
       A Black parent whose daughter attends the Catholic school in Philadelphia told CNN the video was sent directly to his daughter and niece, along with other Black students. 
   
      When asked about whether the video was initially sent to Black students at the school, Kenneth Gavin, chief communications officer for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, told CNN, “At this time it is unknown as to the exact distribution. My understanding is that it was posted and shared on social media.”
   
      The video was taken outside of school and after school hours, a statement provided to CNN by the archdiocese said. 
   
      The school denounced the behavior in the video as “repugnant,” writing that the Anti-Defamation League would offer anti-bias workshops at the school on February 20.  
   
      Faculty and students returned to Saint Hubert Catholic High School on Monday, the school wrote in its statement, adding there would be a “visible and active police presence around the campus perimeter.”
   
      The school wrote it would be addressing all students to outline its plan for “safety and healing moving forward.”

      Get ready for heartbreak in the candy aisle. 
   
      As Valentine’s Day arrives, so does the annual frenzy to buy or gift the classic Russell Stover and Whitman’s Sampler chocolate boxes that come in under $12 or so at Walgreens, CVS, Walmart and Target stores.
   
      But shoppers may be disappointed this year when they open those big red or pink heart-shaped boxes, according to one consumer advocate. That’s because the packaging is misleading, said Edgar Dworsky, a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts, who is editor of the website ConsumerWorld.org. 
   
      There’s sometimes precious little candy inside, he said.
   
      Dworsky said his research shows the over-sized boxes deceive consumers into believing there’s more chocolate inside when there isn’t.
   
      Consumer watchdogs have a name for the tactic, called “slack-fill,” and it’s not allowed under federal law. Regulators judge whether a product is slack-filled by comparing the capacity of the package to the amount of product it actually contains, he said. Then they determine if the extra space in it is nonfunctional and doesn’t serve a legitimate purpose, like protecting the product.
   
      This is different from the “shrinkflation” phenomenon, a product packaging practice that’s typically triggered when inflation surges and companies’ costs go up. To contain those costs, companies put products in packaging that appear smaller, lighter in weight and decorated with less flashy colors.
   
      Dworsky said a reader alerted him to the chocolate boxes a few days ago and sent him evidence of a heart-shaped Whitman’s chocolate sampler box.
   
      The box, 9.3-inches wide and 10-inches high, had a net weight of 5.1 ounces. “That’s a pretty decent size,” said Dworsky. But when the box was opened, it had 11 pieces of chocolate inside. 
   
      So, Dworsky bought a few of this year’s Whitman’s boxes (priced at $7.99 each) and removed all of the inside packaging material and inserts. “The chocolate pieces only filled up one-third of the box.”
   
      Dworsky didn’t have evidence that brands are actually skimping on the chocolates compared to previous years. But CNN found one Russell Stover heart-shaped candy box – with a Best Before date of June 10, 2006 and kept as a memento by one of our staffers – of the same size, 9 inches wide by 10 inches high.
   
      It featured 24 pieces. 
   
       Dworsky also found a 5.1 ounce Russell Stover heart with nine pieces of chocolate inside. “It’s almost double the size of the 4-ounce Russell Stover box, which has seven pieces,” he said.
   
      “Imagine being the recipient of the bigger box. If you’re giving it to your love on Valentine’s Day, they think it’s decent-sized big box of chocolate but then it only has nine pieces in it,” he said. “It’s awful.”
   
      Both brands do disclose on their boxes the weight and the approximate number of candy pieces inside. Swiss chocolate company Lindt & Sprüngli, which owns Russell Stover, Whitman’s and Ghirardelli brands, referred requests for comment to Russell Stover Chocolates.
   
      Russell Stover Chocolates said it “works to clearly indicate to our customers what is included in our packaging.” 
   
      “This includes sharing the product weight and how many pieces are in all of our Valentine’s Day boxed chocolates,” said Patrick Khattak, the brand’s vice president of marketing, in an email to CNN Business.
   
      Regulators have gone after chocolate makers in the past over so-called deception packaging. California district attorneys filed a lawsuit in 2019 against Russell Stover and Ghirardelli for allegedly using false bottoms and other deceptive tactics in some chocolate boxes and bags, making the packaging look more filled than it really was.
   
      Prosecutors also accused Ghirardelli of using less cocoa in their products than advertised. 
   
      The DAs, which included the Santa Cruz District Attorney, settled the case and the companies paid a fine of $750,000 without admitting any wrongdoing, but agreed to make packaging changes.
   
      Edward Browne, an Assistant District Attorney in Santa Cruz, said he will be looking into this recent example of potentially deceptive packaging by the companies. He said Dworsky had reached about to him about his most report looking at the Russell Stover and Whitman’s chocolate candy boxes.
   
      “It’s unfortunate that this situation is still going on. It’s also disappointing,”  Browne told CNN. “We will take a look and see if the companies are taking advantage of any exceptions to the law. There have been many exceptions added since our case in 2019 and they eat up the rule.”

      Florida lawmakers on Friday gave final approval to a proposal to give Gov. Ron DeSantis more control over the future of Disney’s Orlando-area theme parks, the latest escalation in the Republican leader’s feud with the entertainment giant. 
   
      The GOP-led state Senate voted 26-9 Friday on a bill to let the state take over the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the government body that has given Disney unique powers in Central Florida for more than half a century. Under the bill, the district’s existing board will be replaced by a five-member board hand-picked by DeSantis.
   
      The measure passed the Republican-controlled House on an 82-31 vote Thursday. It now heads to the desk of DeSantis, who is expected to sign it. 
   
      The latest move against Disney comes a year after the company spoke out against a bill to restrict certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity. The legislation drew a forceful rebuke from Democrats and LGBTQ advocates, who feared the bill would marginalize LGBTQ students and teachers and make them feel less safe in schools. In March of last year, as outrage against the legislation spread nationwide, Disney released a statement vowing to help get the law repealed or struck down by the courts and saying the company was “dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.”
   
      After signing the bill into law, DeSantis then set his sights on punishing Disney. He called on lawmakers to strip the company of its special governing powers, which they did in a special session last year, voting to dissolve the Reedy Creek Improvement District at the end of May 2023.
   
      Lawmakers, though, changed course this week and instead voted on a new future for Reedy Creek, one that puts DeSantis appointees in charge of the district’s long-standing powers to tax, build and borrow money for projects around Disney’s vast footprint in Orange and Osceola counties. It also renames Reedy Creek as the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.
   
      Proponents say the changes ensure that there will not be a disruption to the district’s existing debt or contracts. The final page of the 189-page bill states: “The Reedy Creek Improvement District is not dissolved as of June 1, 2023, but continues in full force and effect under its new name.” 
   
      The changes seemed to satisfy some concerns that the district’s outstanding debt, reported at about $1 billion, would fall on Florida taxpayers. Fitch Ratings, which put Reedy Creek Improvement District’s debt on watch for a negative bond rating, told CNN in a statement that the proposed legislation “appears to address key uncertainties.”
   
      In a statement to CNN earlier this week, Jeff Vahle, the president of Walt Disney World Resort, said the company is “monitoring the progression of the draft legislation, which is complex given the long history of the Reedy Creek Improvement District.”
   
      “Disney works under a number of different models and jurisdictions around the world, and regardless of the outcome, we remain committed to providing the highest quality experience for the millions of guests who visit each year,” Vahle said.

      An annual ice fishing tournament on Vermont’s Lake Champlain has been canceled after the deaths of three fisherman on the lake since Thursday, an organizer of the tournament told CNN Sunday.  
   
      Wayne Alexander from Grand Isle, Vermont, died Thursday after falling through the ice, according to a release from Vermont State Police. The 62-year-old’s body was found in the water hours after he was expected to return home. His truck was found at the park’s entrance. 
   
      On Saturday, two brothers died after their utility vehicle broke through the ice, police said.  
   
      John Fleury, 71, of Williamstown, was pulled from the water and later died in an area hospital. His brother, Wayne Fleury, 88, of East Montpelier, was located inside the vehicle by a diver from Colchester Technical Rescue and was pronounced dead on the scene, according to an updated police release.  
   
      Gilbert Gagner, a member of the Islands Ice Fishing Derby committee, told CNN this was the tournament’s 43rd year and his 25th involved with it.
   
      The derby raises money for conservation on Lake Champlain. The community looks forward to February for the ice fishing, Gagner told CNN. 
   
      Gagner owns Martin’s General Store, which rents out ice fishing equipment. But due to unusually high temperatures this winter, Gagner told CNN he’s not going back on the ice and is shutting down the rental operation.
   
      “I’ve never seen anything like this,” Gagner said. “This is craziness.”  
   
      While the fishermen who died were not affiliated with the tournament, Gagner said there was no choice but to shut it down.
   
In a Facebook post on Saturday, the National Weather Service Burlington said ice thickness on area lakes and ponds is highly variable due to “well above normal temperatures” in the region over the past two months.  
   
      This year, Montpelier recorded its warmest January since 1948, with Burlington recording its fifth warmest January since 1884, NWS Burlington said on Facebook.  
 
In a Facebook comment on a February 6 video post, NWS Burlington said if it weren’t for the record-setting cold front and that hit the Northeast earlier this month, there would likely be little ice on Lake Champlain.  
   
      “Most years this is about the time ice typically forms on the lake, though it can be quite variable. If it weren’t for the last week of temps there would likely be little ice, and the next 2 weeks is looking warm with several days of wind,” NWS Burlington said.
   
      Gagner said ice in areas of the lake that recently froze over can be misleading and look deceptively thick.
   
      According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ice 6 inches thick or more can support snowmobiles or ATVs. Ice must be at least 9 inches thick to support cars and 12 inches to support medium sized trucks.  
   
      Gagner said there’s about 7 to 11 inches of ice, which is not good enough in certain areas of the lake to support trailers for the tournament.  
   
CNN affiliate WCAX reported that Vermont Fish and Wildlife was advising the public to stay off Lake Champlain.
   
      “We really want to encourage people to not go out on the ice. Clearly it’s not safe. This is the second event we’ve had in two days. So ice safety is the most important thing,” commissioner Christopher Herrick told WCAX.

Subway, one of the world’s most recognizable fast food brands, has confirmed it’s up for sale.
   
      The 58-year-old company said in a statement Tuesday that its shareholders are “exploring a possible sale” of the company and that it has hired J.P. Morgan to help conduct the process. Subway warned that there’s “no indication of timing or assurance that a sale will occur” and it doesn’t intend to make any further public comments until the process is finished. 
   
      The announcement comes a month after the Wall Street Journal broke the news that the 58-year-old chain was exploring a sale. A price tag wasn’t announced in Subway’s statement, but the newspaper said Subway could be valued at more than $10 billion. 
   
      If reached, it would be one of the biggest deals in the fast food industry since Inspire Brands bought Dunkin’ for $11.3 billion in October 2020. 
   
      Bolstered by a revamped menu, store renovations and international growth, Subway has been on the rebound in recent years. The privately held company recently said that sales at its North America stores open at least a year rose 7.8% last year compared to 2021, which Subway said exceeded its projections by more than $700 million (it didn’t reveal specific numbers).
   
      Digital growth was also a highlight for the company, with sales made through its app or third-party services doubling compared to 2021. Its international footprint also grew with more than 750 restaurants opening last year, helping its global same-store sales grow 9.2% year over year.
   
      This year, new meat slicers will roll out at all of its stores — a sharp reversal from its previous method of shipping locations pre-sliced meat.
   
      “We were one of the few, if only, sub shop that didn’t slice in restaurant. Not only does it give the guest a better perception of seeing the nice, fluffy meat, but we save a lot of money since we were paying a lot of money to have it sliced upstream,” Subway CEO John Chidsey previously told CNN. 
   
      The cost savings will be reinvested into the upcoming menu changes, scheduled to debut this summer.

      Ryan Seacrest is saying goodbye to his morning co-host duties alongside Kelly Ripa.
   
      Seacrest and Ripa announced the news during their morning talk show, “Live with Kelly and Ryan” on Thursday.
   
      “I’ve decided to make this my last season as co-host,” Seacrest said, calling his decision, “bittersweet.”
   
      “You’ve gone from being a friend to a family member. You are family to us,” Ripa said. “I’m so proud of you and I cheer you on endlessly.”
   
      Seacrest had originally committed to three years on the show, which turned to six, he said, because of the fun he’s had hosting.
   
      “I look up to you. I respect you so much,” Seacrest said of Ripa. “I love the fact that we get to connect every day. There’s nothing like this on television. This show really comes today because of an incredible family of people.”
   
      Seacrest will be stepping down from the show this spring. As for his replacement? Ripa’s husband, Mark Consuelos will be taking on the gig. 
   
      Consuelos has filled in on the show alongside Ripa countless times over the years.
   
      Seacrest, one of the world’s best-known broadcasters, first joined the hit show in 2017 after ABC began the search for Michael Strahan’s replacement.
   
      Since taking the job, the host has been pulling double - and sometimes triple duty -  between his other gigs as host of “American Idol” and his nationally syndicated radio shows for iHeartMedia. 
   
      “Live” is based in New York. Seacrest’s primary residence is in Los Angeles.

      First term Tennessee state representative Justin Pearson says he was trying to honor his ancestors for helping him rise to elected office when he wore his dashiki on the floor of the House chamber during his swearing-in ceremony Feb. 9.
   
      The freshman lawmaker says he was surprised to hear another member, Rep. David Hawk, criticize him for his attire. Pearson says his colleague scolded him for not adhering to tradition where male lawmakers wear suits and ties on the House floor. 
   
      In his floor speech, according to the House speaker’s office, Hawk referred to the late Rep. Lois DeBerry, who as speaker pro tempore established a precedent of men wearing a coat and tie in the chamber.  
 
      CNN has reached out to Hawk for comment.    
   
      “There’s nothing in the rules about attire at all,” Pearson told CNN, adding that he typically wears his dashiki for special occasions.
   
      After the swearing-in, Pearson took to Twitter to denounce his colleague’s criticism, saying, “…a white supremacist has attacked my wearing of my Dashiki.” Pearson added he understands not conforming to the “status quo ought to make some people uncomfortable.” 
   
      In response to Pearson, the Tennessee House GOP tweeted that if Pearson doesn’t like decorum rules that were approved in a bipartisan manner, he should “explore a different career opportunity.” The tweet adds that reminding members to follow the approved decorum rules is “far from a racist attack.”
   
      A spokesman for Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton told CNN in a statement: “The speaker will continue to follow the precedent and the path established by Ms. DeBerry to honor her and her incredible legacy within our legislative body.”    
   
      Pearson says he will continue to wear his dashiki but will wear a coat and tie with it so he is recognized on the floor and his constituents are represented.
   
      “This doesn’t have anything to do with a dashiki; it’s about who’s wearing it. It’s about us being here,” Pearson told CNN, adding that he wants to make Tennessee more inclusive. “It’s not a problem of dress, it’s a problem of principle that is wrong and lacks inclusivity.”

      Arielle Anderson had a gentle laugh and was full of ambitions: She was studying to become a doctor one day, her aunt said.
   
      “Have you ever met a young person who was simply “Pure in Heart”… well that was @ariellediamond_ … simply PURE … she never raised her voice past a whisper or gentle laugh,” her aunt and reality TV star Chandra Davis said in an Instagram post. “She was a remarkable student, attending MSU to become a doctor.”
   
      Anderson was one of three Michigan State University students killed in a mass shooting on campus Monday night, university police said Tuesday.
   
      The Michigan State University Department of Police and Public Safety identified the three students killed Monday night as juniors Anderson and Alexandria Verner, and sophomore Brian Fraser.
   
      Anderson and Fraser hailed from the same town of Grosse Pointe, Michigan, leaving their hometown with a double loss.
   
      Five other students remain in the hospital,  the release said.
   
      “We cannot begin to fathom the immeasurable amount of pain that our campus community is feeling,” the police release said.
   
      These are the stories of the victims.
   
      Davis said her family is heartbroken and struggling to deal with Anderson’s passing. 
   
      “How is it that she was in class doing what she was supposed to be doing and yet and still her life was taken by a coward who clearly didn’t understand the devastation he was about to cause my entire family,” Davis wrote. 
   
      “No parent should have to bury their children. It truly hurts y’all.”
   
      Anderson’s family remembers her smile and just how hard she worked, the family told the university student paper, The State News.
   
      “She was working diligently to graduate from Michigan State University early to achieve her goals as quickly as possible,” the family said in a statement. “As an Angel here on Earth, Arielle was sweet and loving with an infectious smile that was very contagious. We are absolutely devastated by this heinous act of violence upon her and many other innocent victims.”
   
      Anderson, 19, was the youngest of three siblings and is survived by her mother, brother and sister, according to Davis. 
   
      She graduated in 2021 from Grosse Pointe North High School, according to district superintendent Jon Dean.
   
      Verner was kind, positive and “everything you’d want your daughter or friend to be,” a family friend said.
   
      “Her kindness was on display every single second you were around her,” Clawson Public Schools Superintendent Billy Shellenbarger told CNN. He is friends with the Verner family and has known Alexandria, or Alex, as he called her, since she was in kindergarten.
   
      She was a junior at the university studying biology, according to The State News.
   
      Verner, 20, touched a lot of people in the town of Clawson, Michigan, Shellenbarger said, which he described as a small, 2-mile by 2-mile community.
   
      “To lose her on this planet, let alone our small community, it’s tough,” he said. “And it’s going to take a while to recover, but to have known her for the duration of time that we all have, once again, is a gift to all of us,” he said.
   
      Verner’s family is “being about as strong as a human being can be in the face of this tragedy,” Shellenbarger said, adding he spoke with them Tuesday.
   
      Shellenbarger was the principal at Clawson High School while Verner was a student there. She graduated in 2020.
   
      Verner was a fantastic three-sport athlete in volleyball, basketball and softball, as well as an excellent student who was active in many leadership groups at the school, Shellenbarger said.
   
      Shellenbarger sent a letter to families on Tuesday informing the community of her death and offering resources for students.
   
      “Alex was and is incredibly loved by everyone. She was a tremendous student, athlete, leader and exemplified kindness every day of her life!” he wrote in the letter. “Her parents, Ted and Nancy, and sister Charlotte and brother TJ are equally grieving but are certainly already feeling the uplifting support of this tremendous community.”
   
      “If you knew her, you loved her, and we will forever remember the lasting impact she has had on all of us,” he wrote.
   
      Fraser served as the president of the Michigan Beta Chapter of Phi Delta Theta, the fraternity said in a statement.
   
      He was a leader and a great friend to his brothers, the Greek community and the people he interacted with on campus, the fraternity said.
   
      “Phi Delta Theta sends its deepest condolences to the Fraser family, the Michigan Beta Chapter, and all those who loved Brian as they mourn their loss,” the statement reads.
   
      Fraser, 20, was studying business at the university, the student paper said.
   
      Fraser graduated in 2021 from Grosse Pointe South High School, according to Dean.
   
      “How is it possible that this happened in the first place, an act of senseless violence that has no place in our society and in particular no place in school?” Dean said. “But then, it touched our community not once, but twice.”
   
      Guadalupe Huapilla-Pérez has been identified as one of the injured victims of the shooting, according to a verified GoFundMe campaign and the National HEP CAMP Association, a national educational program Huapilla-Pérez is a part of at the university.
   
      “Guadalupe (Lupe) Huapilla-Pérez is currently recovering from serious injuries related to the shooting,” the organization said on Facebook. “The time away from work for her family, the long recovery road ahead, and the subsequent medical expenses to care for Guadalupe, will place both an emotional and financial a burden on her family.”
   
      Huapilla-Pérez is a junior majoring in hospitality business and a student in the university’s College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP), her sister Selena said in a GoFundMe campaign. 
   
      “She is a leader in the community and beyond,” her sister wrote. “Lupe is incredibly hard-working, focused, and ambitious, choosing a career path that’s never been explored in our family.” 
   
      “While we are happy that Lupe remains with us, we are devastated by the violence that has impacted so many,” Selena wrote. “We hold Guadalupe and all other victims in our hearts.”
   
      One of the injured students from the shooting has been moved to stable condition, the university said Thursday. Four remain in critical condition.
   
      The injured students are “showing signs of improvement,” university Interim President Teresa K. Woodruff said Thursday.
   
      Four of the five injured students from the shooting required surgery and some immediate intervention, Dr. Denny Martin, Interim President and Chief Medical Officer at Sparrow Hospital, said Tuesday. 
   
      “Without going into the specifics of their injuries, I will say that it took a team of numerous anesthesiologist(s), trauma surgeons, general surgeons, cardiothoracic surgery and a neurosurgery team to handle the full extent of the injuries,” he told CNN’s Kate Bolduan.
   
      One student who was injured “did not require immediate surgical intervention” and they were taken directly to the ICU, he said. 
   
      Martin said it’s too early to give a long-term prognosis on their conditions. 
   
      “They’re all under the care of trauma and critical care teams here,” Martin said. “Some are more critical than others, but again, it’s quite early … in their recovery from this event.”

      If you’re making the switch to more vegetarian and plant-based meals, chances are you’ve been adding more beans to your roster of regular dishes. That means you’ve likely been loading up your grocery cart with cans galore. But while canned beans are convenient, I’m here to make the argument for using dried beans in their place. 
   
      (And whether you’re a vegetarian or meat eater, finding a place for beans in your diet is a healthy — and tasty — must.)
   
      Dried or canned, beans are nutritional all-stars. “They’re known for being good sources of both dietary fiber and plant protein. But they also offer up iron, magnesium, potassium, and zinc,” said Gena Hamshaw, a New York-based registered dietitian who specializes in vegan cooking. “It’s hard to find foods that are so rich in so many important and valuable nutrients, not to mention budget-friendly.”
   
      But when it comes to dried beans, these little legumes have a lot more going on for them.
   
      “Dried beans are more economical, in the sense that they cost less, cup for cup, than canned beans. They’re also great for batch cooking, which can help home cooks to save money,” Hamshaw said.
   
      One 15-ounce can of beans yields about 9 ounces of beans once drained, and will cost you approximately $1 at the supermarket. (More on bean weights below.) A pound of dried beans, meanwhile, will give you about 3.5 cans’ worth of beans at a cost between $2 and $3, depending on the brand. I don’t know about you, but I love paying half the price for what I personally find to be a more flavorful product.
   
      “Some canned beans are higher than others in added sodium,” Hamshaw noted, but as an average example, a can of pinto beans contains 270 milligrams of sodium per serving, which is 12% of the recommended daily amount for adults, according to the US Department of Agriculture. 
   
      You can certainly buy low-sodium or no-salt canned beans and rinse them before eating, which can reduce the amount of sodium by up to 40%, according to Bentley, but dried beans contain a much lower amount of sodium, between 0 and 15 milligrams per serving.
   
      In addition, when cooking dried beans, you can control the amount of salt you add, as well as any other spices and flavorings. (Some seasoning blends do contain additional sodium, so make sure to read all spice labels if you’re closely monitoring your sodium intake.)
   
      Why not move beyond the grocery store staples — pinto, black or kidney — and try a lesser-known bean? Rancho Gordo, Zursun, North Bay Trading and Primary Beans are just a few of the many purveyors of heirloom bean varieties; some of my personal favorites include buckeye, flageolet and scarlet runner beans. While these beans have a higher price tag than bulk bin varieties, it’s fun and tasty to experiment with new flavors.
   
      Let’s dispel the biggest misconception about dried beans — they require just about as much hands-on prep time as finding a can opener, opening a can, draining and rinsing. In fact, the easiest way to prepare dried beans is with an Instant Pot or other brand of multicooker. And no, you don’t have to presoak them if you don’t want to (or if you just forget).
   
      The argument for soaking is because, even though the beans are already dried, they lose moisture over time. If a bag of beans has been on the pantry shelf for a year, they’ll be more desiccated than a freshly dried batch. Giving the beans a soak lets them rehydrate — think of it as a water marinade, slowly penetrating each bean to give it moisture. 
   
      But I’ve found that pressure cooking dried beans in an Instant Pot or other multicooker is 99% foolproof whether you’ve presoaked them or not. While you can always cook your beans on the stovetop, pressure cooking is a hands-off method — my favorite “set it and forget it” technique — that produces reliable results.
   
      If you want to presoak your beans, place them in a bowl and fill with enough water to cover the beans by about 3 inches. The beans will absorb the water and increase in size a bit as they soak, so make sure you use a large enough bowl to accommodate them.
   
      Soak for at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours, then drain the beans and transfer to the Instant Pot or other pressure cooker.
   
      If you’ve presoaked your beans, fill the pot with enough water to cover the beans by at least 1 inch. If you haven’t soaked them, use enough water to cover the beans by at least 3 to 4 inches.
   
      Add a pinch of salt, spices — I like to mix it up with chili powder, Old Bay seasoning, garlic powder or onion powder — and any aromatics, such as onions, bay leaves or garlic cloves.
   
      Seal the lid and cook on high pressure. Smaller beans typically take less time than larger beans do, and because all pressure cookers have their own little quirks, you’ll find the perfect time for your model as you make beans more often. Soaked beans should require between 20 to 25 minutes to cook; for unsoaked beans, it’s around 40 to 45 minutes.
   
      Once the cooking cycle has ended, turn the pot off and let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes before opening.
   
      If you’re not using your beans immediately, store them in their cooking liquid for the best texture and flavor.
   
      I find it easiest and most accurate to measure beans by weight rather than volume, since beans come in various shapes and sizes. 
   
      One 15-ounce can of beans, once drained, yields about 9 ounces (or 255 grams) of beans. Because dried beans double in weight when cooked, you’ll need the halve the amount you use in recipes with canned beans. So 4.5 ounces (or 128 grams) of dried beans should be equivalent to one can; 9 ounces (or 225 grams) of dried beans to two cans and so on.
   
      With these ratios, you’ll be able to make a big pot of dried beans and portion them out for future meals, or make as much as you need to replace canned beans in any recipe. Here’s a few suggestions to get you started:
   
Pinto beans:
 
      • Borracho beans, sometimes called cowboy beans or ranch beans, are a versatile filling for burrito bowls, enchiladas, tacos or as a side dish. 
   
      • Refried beans are so much better made from scratch than straight out of the can. Once you try a homemade version, it’s hard to go back.
   
Black beans:
 
      • Tostadas are a crunchy vehicle for a spicy black bean puree, and an ideal recipe for when you’re short on time and have extra beans on hand.
   
      • Black bean chili is so simple to make in a pressure cooker when you can throw all the ingredients in at once. 
   
White beans:
 
      • Use tender cannellini beans or other white beans to make a tangy and sweet vegetarian version of baked beans.
   
      • Pasta fagioli is an Italian bean-and-pasta stew that’s great with any style of white beans, such as Great Northern, navy or flageolet. 
   
Garbanzo beans:
 
      • Hummus is probably the most popular dish using garbanzo beans, or chickpeas, and it’s so smooth and creamy when made fresh.
   
      • Chickpea coconut curry doesn’t just roll off your tongue — it’s a classic combination for a vegan weeknight meal.

      A Missouri man who has been serving a life sentence for nearly three decades was set free Tuesday after a judge ruled he is innocent and vacated his murder conviction. 
   
      Lamar Johnson was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in 1995 after being convicted of murder in the death of Markus Boyd the year prior. At the time, police said Johnson and another man, Phillip Campbell, shot and killed Boyd. 
   
      But Johnson was given a new hearing after St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner filed a motion last year saying his conviction was based in large part on false eyewitness testimony and accusing prosecutors and investigators of misconduct.  
   
      On Tuesday, Missouri Circuit Court Judge David Mason ruled that Johnson’s trial included “constitutional error” and said “there is clear and convincing evidence of Lamar Johnson’s actual innocence,” according to the judge’s order. 
   
      Johnson appeared to tear up in the courtroom as Mason announced his decision. Johnson smiled broadly as he left the courthouse and declined to speak to reporters.
   
      “This is an amazing day that we showed that the city of St. Louis and the state of Missouri is about justice and not defending the finality of a conviction,” Gardner said following the ruling. 
   
      Gardner asked the court to vacate Johnson’s murder conviction after the sole eyewitness at trial recanted, and Campbell and another man signed sworn affidavits confessing to involvement in Boyd’s murder.
   
      During a five-day court hearing held in December, the other man, James Howard, testified that he and Campbell – who has since died – shot Boyd over a drug dispute, the order says.
   
      Howard was sentenced to life in a separate homicide and Campbell served less than six years for Boyd’s killing, one of Johnson’s attorneys has said. 
   
      On the night of Boyd’s killing, Johnson had an alibi and prosecutors did not present any physical evidence linking him to the killing, Mason’s order says. 
   
      Instead, prosecutors relied heavily on a single eyewitness, James Elking, who identified Johnson as one of the killers, the document says.
   
      During the new hearing, Elking again recanted his identification of Johnson as the one who shot Boyd, the order says. The hearing also determined prosecutors paid him more than $4,000 in “witness compensation” before the trial that was not disclosed at the time, the order says. 
   
      Dwight Warren, the lead prosecutor of the original case, told CNN in 2019 that the witness “may have been compensated out of fear for his life and we may have relocated him, but this was 25 years ago and I cannot tell you with certainty.”
   
      Evidence presented in the hearing showed that police interfered with Elking’s initial identification – with Elking saying during December’s proceedings that he felt pressured to pick someone out of a line-up – the order reads. Prosecutors later withheld evidence that would have undermined Elking’s trial testimony, Mason’s order says.
   
      Warren said in 2019 that the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct were “outlandish” and a “one-sided hatchet job.”
   
      The Midwest Innocence Project, which has provided legal support to Johnson, says he is not eligible to seek any compensation for his imprisonment under state law. The group established a GoFundMe page to help start his new life outside prison, saying Johnson “will enter the free world with no resources to begin his new life outside of prison walls.

      The FBI has conducted two searches at the University of Delaware in connection with the investigation into President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. 
   
      The previously undisclosed searches were conducted in recent weeks, with the consent and cooperation of the president’s legal team, the source said.
   
      The library at the University of Delaware, Biden’s alma mater, is home to an extensive collection of papers from the president’s time in the Senate, according to its website. 
   
      Investigators retrieved materials from two university locations on two different days. The material did not appear to have classified markings, according to the source, but they are now being reviewed by the FBI. 
   
      They examined two separate batches of documents during the searches: an archive of materials from Biden’s time in the US Senate and documents that Biden sent to the university in recent years.  
   
      Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the president’s personal attorney, did not comment and referred inquiries to the Justice Department. A spokesman for the White House also referred inquiries to the Justice Department.
   
      The Justice Department declined to comment. The University of Delaware did not respond to a request for comment.
   
      The more than 1,850 boxes of records have not been open to the public since the collection arrived at the university in 2012, the website states.  
   
      The searches at the University of Delaware are the most recent move by investigators to locate any previously unknown classified documents. FBI agents have searched Biden’s two homes in Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, as well as the Washington office of the Penn Biden Center. The FBI found classified documents in Biden’s Wilmington home and also took some materials from his time in the Senate from that location, CNN has reported, as well as at the Penn Biden Center office.

      After spending nearly 10 months imprisoned in Russia, WNBA star Brittney Griner is making her return to basketball in the upcoming season, signing a one-year deal with the Phoenix Mercury, according to ESPN and The Athletic, who cited multiple unnamed sources.
   
      The two-time Olympic gold medalist was released in December – after spending nearly 300 days in Russian custody – in a prisoner exchange with Russia. 
   
      And as soon as she was back home, she vowed to play in the WNBA again.
 
      “It feels so good to be home! The last 10 months have been a battle at every turn,” she wrote in a December post on Instagram. “I dug deep to keep my faith and it was the love from so many of you that helped keep me going. From the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone for your help.”
   
      “I also want to make one thing very clear: I intend to play basketball for the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury this season, and in doing so, I look forward to being able to say ‘thank you’ to those of you who advocated, wrote, and posted for me in person soon,” Griner said.
   
      Griner – who for years had played in the WNBA off-season for a Russian women’s basketball team – was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region in February 2022. Her detention, which became an international cause during a tense time in relations between the US and Russia, was deemed wrongful by American officials. 
   
      And despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil that was found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in the Mordovia republic in mid-November after losing her appeal.
 
      The 32-year-old last played with the Mercury in 2021, helping lead the team to the WNBA Finals, which they lost to the Chicago Sky.
   
      Before that, the seven-time All-Star had played all nine seasons with the franchise since being selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 WNBA Draft.
   
      Phoenix are scheduled to open the season on the road against the Los Angeles Sparks on May 19. The team will play their first home game against the Sky on May 21.
   
      CNN has reached out to Griner’s representatives and the Phoenix Mercury but did not immediately hear back.

      Twitter Blue subscribers will be the platform’s only users able to use text messages as a two-factor authentication method, Twitter announced Friday. 
   
      The change will take place on March 20. Twitter users will have two other ways to authenticate their Twitter log-ins at no cost: an authentication mobile app and a security key. 
   
      Two factor authentication, or 2FA, requires users to type in their password and then enter a code or security key to access their accounts. It is one of the primary methods for users to keep their Twitter account secure. 
   
      “While historically a popular form of 2FA, unfortunately we have seen phone-number based 2FA be used - and abused - by bad actors,” the company said in a blog post Friday. “So starting today, we will no longer allow accounts to enroll in the text message/SMS method of 2FA unless they are Twitter Blue subscribers.”
   
      Twitter Blue, which costs $11 a month for iOS and Android subscribers, adds a blue checkmark to the account of anyone willing to pay for one. 
   
      As of 2021, only 2.6% of Twitter users had a 2FA method enabled – and of those, 74.4% used SMS authentication, a Twitter account security report said. 
   
      Twitter said non-subscribers will have 30 days to disable the text method and enroll in another way to sign in using 2FA. Disabling text message 2FA won’t automatically disassociate the user’s phone number from their account, Twitter said. 
   
      Musk responded “Yup” to a tweet claiming a telecommunications company used bot accounts “to Pump 2FA SMS” and that Twitter was losing $60 million a year “on scam SMS.”

      Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny is fond of a phrase, “the wonderful Russia of the future,” his shorthand for a country without President Vladimir Putin. 
   
      But in the year that has passed since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has gone back to a dark, repressive past.
   
      Over the last 12 months, Putin’s government has crushed the remnants of Russia’s civil society and presided over his country’s first military mobilization since World War II. Political opponents such as Navalny are in prison or out of the country. And Putin has made it clear that he seeks to reassert Russia as an empire in which Ukraine has no place as an independent state.  
   
      The war in Ukraine drew a bright line under the period of High Putinism, a decade that began with Putin’s controversial return to the presidency in 2012. That era, in hindsight, was a prelude to the current war: Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and backed armed separatists in Ukraine’s Donbas region, while Putin’s technocrats worked on sanction-proofing the Russian economy.
   
      Since last February’s invasion, Putin has shrugged off protests and international sanctions. Independent media and human rights groups have been branded as foreign agents or shut down entirely.
   
      Russia is now in an uncertain new phase, and it’s clear there will be no rewind, no return to the status quo ante, for ordinary citizens.
   
      So is Putin’s grip on power unchallenged? Rumors are now flying inside the country about another wave of mobilization. And in Moscow, signs of elite competition are beginning to emerge, even as some Russians are seeing through the cracks in the wall of state propaganda.
   
      On February 2, Putin paid a visit to the southern Russian city of Volgograd to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory at what was then called Stalingrad, a crucial turning point in what the Russians call the Great Patriotic War. 
   
      In his speech at a gala concert in Volgograd, Putin made a direct link between the Battle of Stalingrad – the moment when the momentum shifted on the Eastern Front against Nazi Germany – and the war in Ukraine, warning that Russia faced a similar threat from a “collective West” bent on its destruction. 
   
      “Those who draw the European countries, including Germany, into a new war with Russia – and all the more irresponsibly declare this as a fait accompli – those who expect to win a victory over Russia on the battlefield, apparently do not understand that a modern war with Russia will be completely different for them,” he warned.
   
      Invoking Stalingrad was a response to Germany’s decision to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, something Putin complained was “unbelievable, but true.” But the President’s visit to Volgograd had an element of what well-known Russian political scientist Kirill Rogov described as the “cosplay” – costume play – that Russia’s ruling class uses to drape their policies in the garments of a heroic past.
   
      “Putin arrived in Volgograd, which was renamed Stalingrad for a few days on the occasion of the anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad,” Rogov wrote on Telegram. “The anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad, which is perceived as a turning point in the Patriotic War, is, of course, used as a great allusion and patriotic warm-up before the decisive second offensive against Ukraine that is being prepared.”
   
      Ukrainian officials have been warning for weeks that Russia may be preparing a major new assault, perhaps to coincide with the anniversary of the 2022 invasion. Back in September, Putin ordered a “partial mobilization” after a swift and unexpected Ukrainian counteroffensive that chased Russian forces out of the northeastern Kharkiv region and set the stage for Ukraine’s recapture of the southern city of Kherson. Many of those troops have now gone through the training pipeline, further fueling speculation that Russia is committed to a manpower-intensive war of attrition.
   
      Observers also note that Russia’s military has been adapting. While Putin never got the victory parade in Kyiv his generals were planning for, he has appointed a new battlefield commander, signaling another change in strategy.
   
      “After the failure of the (2022) blitzkrieg, Russia adapted and placed its bets on a long war, relying on its superior numbers in population, resources, military industry and the size of its territory beyond reach of enemy strikes,” Russian political observer and commentator Alexander Baunov wrote in a recent Telegram post. “This is a war of attrition that can be won without involving too many people … On the strategy of ‘wait them out, add pressure, put the squeeze on.’”
   
      War, however, is fluid and unpredictable. As Baunov noted, the recent decision by Germany, the United States and other European allies to deliver main battle tanks to Ukraine may test Putin’s long game.
   
      “A return to rapid warfare with tanks ruins this new strategy that Russia has just set its sights on,” Baunov wrote. “New people may also be needed to hold the front, and this is risky.” 
   
      Exactly why this is risky should be clear: The first mobilization caused major tremors in Russian society. Hundreds of thousands of Russians voted with their feet. Protests erupted in ethnic minority regions such as Dagestan where police faced off against anti-mobilization demonstrators in multiple cities. Russian social media saw a surge of videos and public complaints about the lack of equipment and appalling conditions for newly mobilized recruits. 
   
      Putin was able to weather the unrest with his formidable and well-funded security apparatus, much as he was able to crack down on antiwar protests that broke out right after the February 24 invasion. And in the months that followed mobilization, Russia made some slow, grinding advances in Ukraine’s Donbas region, particularly around the embattled city of Bakhmut. 
   
      Many of those advances have been led by soldiers of the Wagner Group, a private military company headed by oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin. Many reports on Wagner have focused on the group’s brutal tactics, including human-wave attacks and summary execution for waverers or deserters. 
   
      But Wagner’s methods are also a flashback to a bleak chapter of Soviet history. Prigozhin has recruited thousands of prisoners with the promise of amnesty or a pardon, a practice that mirrors Stalin’s use of penal battalions and convicts to take on desperate or suicidal missions in the toughest sectors of the front, using human-wave attacks to overwhelm enemy defenses, regardless of the human cost. 
   
      The mercenary group says it is no longer recruiting prisoners, but Wagner’s costly battlefield successes have raised Prigozhin’s profile. While the oligarch has no official government office or administrative power, his ability to deliver some results and his swaggering PR operation have vaulted him significantly closer to Putin. 
   
      How close, exactly, is a matter of intense debate. In an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Russian author and journalist Mikhail Zygar called Prigozhin’s ambitions “the most hot topic for speculation in Moscow,” noting that he is accumulating a political following that would potentially allow him to challenge Putin.
   
      “He’s the first folk hero (in) many years,” Zygar said. “He’s a hero for the most ultraconservative – the most, I would say, fascist – part of Russian society, as long as we don’t have any liberal part in Russian society, because most of the leaders of that part of Russian society have left, he’s an obvious rival to President Putin.” 
   
      Recent speculation has centered on whether rivals within Russia’s power elite have been trying to clip Prigozhin’s wings. Russian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya recently offered a skeptical take on Prigozhin’s rise that factors in some of those considerations. In a recent article published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, she noted that Prigozhin has rivalries with Russia’s power ministries and doesn’t have much showing in polls.
   
      “Is Prigozhin ready to challenge Putin?” she wrote in a recent piece. “While the answer is negative, there is one important ‘but.’ It is difficult to remain balanced and sane after going through bloody meat grinders and losing a significant part of one’s personnel. As long as Putin is relatively strong and able to maintain a balance between groups of influence, Prigozhin is safe. But the slightest easing could provoke Prigozhin to challenge power, even if not directly to Putin at first. War breeds monsters, whose recklessness and desperation can become a challenge to the state.”  
   
      Part of the fascination with Prigozhin has to do with the fact that Putin, until a year ago, enjoyed a secure monopoly on power. The authorities were well practiced in quashing street protests, and any meaningful political opposition had been effectively neutered. That’s fueled speculation – or perhaps wishful thinking – that the collapse of Putinism might be brought on by some fissure within the elite. The so-called siloviki (the hardcore authoritarians in Putin’s inner circle) remain publicly loyal, but further setbacks in Ukraine may create a potential scramble for power.
   
      Against that backdrop, some Russians have taken refuge in a form of political apathy. CNN recently spoke to several Muscovites about how their lives have changed since last year, on condition that their surnames not be used over the risks of publicly criticizing the government.
   
      “There have been a lot of changes (in Russia), but I can’t really make a difference,” said Ira, a 47-year-old who works for a business publication. “I just try to keep some internal balance. Maybe I’m too apolitical, but I don’t feel it (further mobilization) is going to happen.”
   
      Ira said she felt acute anxiety in February and March of last year, immediately after the invasion. She had just bought an apartment and was worried that work might dry up and she wouldn’t be able to pay her mortgage. 
   
      “It got a lot worse in the spring,” she said. “Now it seems we’ve gotten used to a new reality. I started to meet and go out with girlfriends. I started to buy a lot more wine.”
   
      The restaurants are now full, she said, but added: “The faces look completely different. The hipsters – you know what hipsters are? – there are less of them.”
   
      Ira doesn’t have a son, so she does not have to worry about him being mobilized. But she did say that her 21-year-old daughter has started going out to kvartirnik – informal, word-of-mouth gatherings in private apartments, somewhat reminiscent of the underground performances held in the Soviet era.  
   
      Olya, a 51-year-old events organizer with two teenage children, said her family had opted for more domestic holidays. Europe is largely closed to direct flights from Russia, and opportunities to travel abroad are more limited.
   
      “We started to travel around the country more,” she said. 
   
      Olya and her family travel with a group of friends, but some topics are off-limits in that circle.
   
      “We know in our group what everyone thinks about it (the war) but we don’t talk about it, otherwise we’ll end up squabbling,” she said.  
   
      Life carries on, Olya said, even though there is a war on. “I can’t influence the situation,” she said. “My friends say, we do what we can, what’s possible. It doesn’t help to get depressed.” 
   
      Helping matters for the Russian government is the unexpected durability of parts of the Russian economy, despite heavy Western sanctions. The war has been costly for the government – the country’s Finance Ministry recently admitted it ran a higher-than-expected deficit in 2022, in large part due to a 30% increase in defense spending over the previous year – but the International Monetary Fund is projecting a small return to GDP growth for Russia in 2023 of 0.3%.
   
      A 38-year-old entrepreneur named Georgy told CNN that from the perspective of his businesses, things appeared to be picking up. 
   
      “Those who adapted quickly reorganized, they are seeing growth,” he said. “In January we concluded an unusual number of deals, and most of our activity usually picks up in February.”
   
      Georgy spoke to CNN while in a Moscow traffic snarl, evidence that life in the capital has resumed some of its normal rhythm. 
   
      “In terms of everyday life, practically nothing has changed,” he said, talking about the cutoff of Western imports. “If we’re talking parts for a (Mercedes Benz) G-Class, it might be trickier.”
   
      Asked if his business was affected by the exodus of Russians since the beginning of the war, Georgy said no. 
   
      “Those I know personally who left? Probably about five people,” he said. “I have a patriotic social circle.” 
   
      Georgy said he was skeptical of state media, saying he looked for other sources of information. And he acknowledged that he could theoretically be called up in another wave of mobilization. 
   
      “My attitude is somewhat philosophical,” he said. “Of course, I’d prefer not to.” 
   
      Before last February, Russia’s budding middle class could benefit from Putin’s social contract: Stay out of politics, and you’ll enjoy life in a European-style Moscow or St. Petersburg. Now that the bargain is out the window. Russia is further than ever from Europe, and it remains to be seen if support for an open-ended war can be sustained.

Could existing AI turn her into reality?,"There is no shortage of robot uprising fiction in the Western canon (see: the works of Ray Bradbury and Philip K.

      There is no shortage of robot uprising fiction in the Western canon (see: the works of Ray Bradbury and Philip K. Dick; classics like “The Terminator”; family-friendly spins like “The Mitchells vs. the Machines”). It’s a conceit that preys on one of mankind’s great fears, that robots will replace us. 
   
      But there’s just something about M3GAN that makes for an ideal monster and the film in which she stars a particularly chilling cautionary tale. (And a popular one at that – “M3GAN” has already made over $91 million globally with a sequel on the way.)
   
      True, M3GAN is an immaculately coiffed humanoid doll with killer instinct and distinct fashion sense. A robot that advanced and, frankly, insolent seems unlikely to take over the world anytime soon. But her eponymous film has also come out during the advent of advanced AI that can hold conversations and write essays or create intricate works of digital art. 
   
      “M3GAN is a metaphor for a lot of stuff happening in our lives, (including) the unintended consequences of autonomous robotics,” said Daniel H. Wilson, a science fiction author and erstwhile roboticist, in an interview with CNN.
   
      “M3GAN” raises questions about our human tendency to rely on technology including artificial intelligence, which is already seamlessly integrated into many of our lives, even if it’s not in the form of a well-dressed robot tucking children into bed. We regularly consult Siri or Alexa, the built-in assistants of Apple and Amazon products, respectively; many consumers clamor buy Teslas, with their semi-self-driving capabilities; and most of us can spend hours scrolling through social media thanks to algorithms meant to maximize the amount of time and attention we give to those platforms. 
   
      Much of “M3GAN” is pure fiction – there are not currently robots that can move as fluidly as M3GAN does when she’s charging at enemies at full speed. But the AI model that powers M3GAN is real, if not immediately available, said Shelly Palmer, professor of advanced media in residence at Syracuse University and expert in fields including emerging tech.
   
      “The tech is absolutely coming – but the real wild card is human beings,” Wilson said.
   
      Mechanically, no, technology has not caught up to make M3GAN in real life, both Palmer and Wilson said. Making a bipedal robot who fluidly runs and flips and perfectly executes TikTok dances before executing humans she perceives as threats is not yet possible. 
   
      Maybe you’re familiar with the work of Boston Dynamics, the company whose four-legged robots are able to walk with relative ease and carry heavy items (and which inspired a man-vs.-machine episode of “Black Mirror”). Wilson and Palmer both pointed to the company as one leading the robotics field, with fully mobile bots already in use in industries including construction and law enforcement (the company says Spot is used to assess potentially toxic materials or dangerous environments). Even it hasn’t created a robot comparable to M3GAN.
   
      But the AI systems that power M3GAN in the film are already in the works, Palmer and WIlson said. In a blog post, Palmer wrote that the “AGI systems,” or “artificial general intelligence,” which describes a bot’s ability to learn anything that a human can, will soon be ready to be implemented. 
   
      “The tech for a doll like M3GAN is absolutely here, and an affordable version will be coming down the line at some point,” said “Robopocalypse” author Wilson. “The question is whether we want it.” (Based on humankind’s well-documented fears of dolls and a robot-dominated future, it’s likely many of us won’t.)
   
      Wilson’s “How to Survive a Robot Uprising” was published in 2005 and technology has evolved tremendously since then. At the time, he said he did not believe a robot uprising was inevitable. But there is tech that worries him today, he told CNN, and it’s not robots who take a physical form but AI products that mimic the reactions of humans.
   
      “We’re fundamentally afraid that robots will replace us,” Wilson said. “For a long time, we were afraid they were going to replace our jobs … but now I think they’re going to replace us in intimate places, in relationships.” (Some may recall this being a key theme in the 2013 film, “Her.”)
   
      He pointed to M3GAN – she acts as a friend to young Cady, who loses her parents in a car accident. M3GAN fills the comforting role ceded by Gemma, a chilly roboticist who struggles to adequately console her orphaned niece. But advanced AI does not expect reciprocity. Humans may not seek friends in fellow humans, those foible-prone folks, because they can get everything they want from robots, who are designed to serve, Wilson said.
   
      AI already harms people “every day,” Palmer said, albeit in less visible ways than, say, M3GAN knocking a young bully into oncoming traffic. Social media addiction, he said, is powered by AI, as is the “prolific dissemination of misinformation.
   
      “The science fiction version of robots or AI falling into a ‘man vs. machine’ conflict is embellished to make good visuals – the truth is far more subtle and is and has been going on for years,” Palmer said. 
   
      New tools like the popular chatbot ChatGPT can closely replicate human speech, but as with any form of social media, it also wants to keep users’ attention, Wilson said. 
   
      “What I’m scared of is social media combining with generative artificial networks – ChatGPT could take a whole generation of people down a conspiracy theory rabbit hole,” he said. “Social media just wants to dominate your attention and will say or do anything it can to maximize those interactions.” 
   
      ChatGPT and other forms of AI are not inherently evil, Palmer said, but they will almost certainly be used in ways their creators did not intend. If there’s a form of technology widely available, be it a rock or a gun or a cell phone, someone will attempt to misuse it. 
   
      “Most technology is neither good nor bad,” Palmer said. “That distinction is reserved for people.” 
   
      Wilson put himself in Allison Williams’ characters’ sensible shoes to explain how a roboticist could avoid making a hypothetical M3GAN into a killing machine. 
   
      “If I wanted to make M3GAN as a product and make sure she did not go on a deadly robotic rampage, I would integrate some design characteristics that make it so the robot can’t kill people,” he said. 
   
      He’d make his M3GAN physically weak so she isn’t capable of hurling humans or heavy objects. He wouldn’t implement a black box model, which prevents users from understanding how an AI product operates, making it easier to run diagnostics on the robo-doll. But most important, he said, is ensuring M3GAN is hacker-proof. If a malevolent hacker is able to infiltrate M3GAN, they could use it to access private information information or cause physical harm, he said. 
   
      And on the off-chance that M3GAN does in fact go rogue, Wilson said some advice from his first book still stands: “Always go for the sensors first.” Take out the cameras that your robotic enemy uses to see you and you’ve already won.

      Ireland Baldwin is getting candid about the difficulties she’s facing during her pregnancy.
   
      The daughter of Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger posted a lengthy note on her verified Instagram account on Wednesday about her experience. 
 
      “Pregnancy is hard,” the expectant mother wrote. “It takes so much out of you. I wasn’t ready for that.”
   
      Baldwin, 27, is expecting her first child with her boyfriend, musician RAC, with whom she lives with and owns a business in Gearhart, Oregon. 
   
      In her note, Baldwin wrote that she “grew up with a very jaded perception of what love really looked like” and touched on the difficulties of being away from family during this time.
   
      “It’s hard not being really close to family to begin with because they live far or are idiots that I want nothing to do with,” Baldwin wrote. “It’s hard seeing other people go through this and have their parents close by.”
   
      She praised her boyfriend, writing that without him, she feels like she would have “lost my mind.”
   
      Baldwin ended her post with encouragement for others.
   
      “All of this is still worth it but its ok to admit how hard and scary it can all be,” she wrote. “You are not alone.”

      Despite facing involuntary manslaughter charges connected to the “Rust” set shooting death of a cinematographer, Alec Baldwin intends to finish the movie’s production, a source close to the actor told CNN. 
   
      Meanwhile, the New Mexico prosecutor who is planning to charge Baldwin is gearing up for a big trial.
   
      First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies requested $635,000 in “emergency” money “to prosecute such a high-profile case,” she wrote to state officials last August.
   
      “I need funding for an attorney, investigator, media contact person, paralegal, expert witnesses, and general trial expenses.”
   
      She said the trials of Baldwin and another person working on the movie “Rust” would each “take weeks to a month to complete” and require expert testimony.
   
      And even before any trial could be held, each defendant will have a preliminary hearing to determine if probable cause for trial exists. “These hearings will take weeks to complete and will happen rather quickly once charges are filed,” she said.
   
      Carmack-Altwies said Thursday she will charge Baldwin and the film’s armorer with involuntary manslaughter, accusing them of failing to perform safety procedures that could have prevented the accident. Baldwin was holding the prop gun that discharged, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the New Mexico set in October 2021. 
   
      Baldwin did not answer reporters’ requests for comment on the charges while walking into his Manhattan home on Friday. 
   
      Melina Spadone, an attorney for Rust Movie Productions, confirmed to CNN Friday the “Rust” film is “still on track for completion” and will star Baldwin in the lead role. 
   
      The film will include “on-set safety supervisors and union crew members and will bar any use of working weapons or any ammunition,” Spadone said, adding Joel Souza will continue to direct the film. 
   
      Carmack-Altwies requested the extra money in a letter dated August 30. She was granted about half of the amount requested, and is expected to ask the legislature for the remainder.
   
      If the case goes to trial, there are few precedents for a major star being charged in the shooting death of a colleague during production of a movie. The attention would likely be enormous, particularly since the shooting happened away from Hollywood.
   
      In the 1980s, director John Landis and four associates were acquitted of involuntary manslaughter in connection with the deaths of actor Vic Morrow and two children during the filming of “Twilight Zone: The Movie.” The trial lasted for 10 months and gained global attention.
   
      Some jurors said they were not dazzled by figures from the film industry since they lived in Los Angeles. Rather, they told The New York Times that prosecutors “had not proved that anyone could have foreseen the crash of the helicopter.”
   
      Baldwin has been a major film and TV star for decades, winning Emmys for TV’s “30 Rock” and an Oscar nomination for “The Cooler.” He also starred in “Working Girl,” “Beetlejuice” and “The Hunt for Red October,” and on Broadway. In addition, he is known for publicly advocating for liberal political causes.
   
      Prosecutors will have to overcome significant challenges, including not knowing how live rounds got on set and experts’ varying opinions about the on-set responsibilities of actors and crew members, said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig.
   
      “Remember, this is a criminal case. You need all 12 jurors to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. So I’m not saying that there’s no chance here, but this is a really difficult case for the prosecution,” Honig said.
   
      The charges will be formally filed by the end of the month, Carmack-Altwies told CNN. 
   
      The prosecutor said she will not request the arrests of Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed. Instead, they will be summoned to appear in court either in-person or virtually, she said.
   
      Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will each face two counts of involuntary manslaughter, but each count carries a different level of punishment, Carmack-Altwies said when she announced the charges. 
   
      A jury would decide which count would be more appropriate, and if convicted, they will only be sentenced to one count, the prosecutor said.  
   
      In either defendant’s case, a conviction is punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 fine. But one charge carries an additional firearms enhancement – because a gun was involved – and would require a mandatory punishment of five years in jail, the prosecutor said. 
   
      Hutchins was killed when a prop gun Baldwin was holding fired a live round of ammunition, striking Hutchins in the chest and hitting Souza, the director, in the shoulder. 
   
      Baldwin has maintained that he never pulled the trigger and was not aware the gun contained live rounds. Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the set armorer who loaded the prop gun, says she believed the rounds were dummy ammunition, according to her lawyer. 
   
      Prosecutors, however, say both Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were responsible for checking the safety of the prop. 
   
      “Every person that handles a gun has a duty to make sure that if they’re going to handle that gun, point it at someone and pull the trigger, that it is not going to fire a projectile and kill someone,” Carmack-Altwies told CNN Thursday. 
   
      Though a medical examiner determined Hutchins’ death was an accident, prosecutors argue the “fast and loose” safety standards on set and lack of caution around firearms props contributed to the fatal shooting. 
   
      “There was such a lack of safety and safety standards on that set,” Carmack-Altwies told CNN, adding that live rounds were mixed with dummy rounds on set.
   
      “Nobody was checking those or at least they weren’t checking them consistently,” she said. “And then they somehow got loaded into a gun handed off to Alec Baldwin. He didn’t check it. He didn’t do any of the things that he was supposed to do to make sure that he was safe or that anyone around him was safe. And then he pointed the gun at Halyna Hutchins and he pulled the trigger.”
   
      Baldwin has said he did not pull the trigger before the gun fired. 
   
      During FBI testing of the the gun’s normal functioning, the weapon could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the firearm was cocked, an FBI forensics report said. Eventually, the gun malfunctioned during testing after internal parts fractured, which caused the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger, the report said.
   
      In addition to acting in “Rust,” Baldwin was also producing the film. Prosecutors will be charging him in both capacities, Carmack-Altwies explained, saying that as a producer, Baldwin had a responsibility to ensure the set was safe. 
   
      Ultimately, the prosecutor said, “just because it’s an accident doesn’t mean that it’s not criminal.”
   
      “Our involuntary manslaughter statute covers unintentional killings,” she said. “Unintentional that means they didn’t mean to do it. They didn’t have the intent to kill. But it happened anyway, and it happened because of more than mere negligence… They didn’t exercise due caution or circumspection and that’s what happened here.”
   
      In September, Carmack-Altwies requested additional funding from the state, noting that her office could charge up to four people in costly cases that “look to be too big for just my office to handle.” State officials approved more than $300,000 of the $635,000 the prosecutor requested, leaving open the possibility of additional funds at a later time. 
   
      Baldwin’s attorney Luke Nikas said the actor was “blindsided” by the charges, which Nikas called “a terrible miscarriage of justice.”
   
      “Mr. Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun – or anywhere on the movie set. He relied on the professionals with whom he worked, who assured him the gun did not have live rounds,” Nikas said.
   
      The executive director of the entertainment union SAG-AFTRA called the anticipated charges against Baldwin “wrong and uninformed.”
   
      “The charges clearly indicate a lack of understanding about the standards and expectations of how a film set operates,” Duncan Crabtree-Ireland told CNN’s Laura Coates. “The fact is, actors are not firearms experts. Actors cannot be expected and are not expected to do final safety checks or anything of that nature.”
   
      Gutierrez Reed’s attorney Jason Bowles said, “We were expecting the charges but they’re absolutely wrong as to Hannah - we expect that she will be found not guilty by a jury and she did not commit manslaughter.”
   
      Hutchins’ family said in a statement Thursday that they support the charges and “fervently hope the justice system works to protect the public and hold accountable those who break the law.”
   
      “It is a comfort to the family that, in New Mexico, no one is above the law,” the statement said.
   
      In an interview with CNN in August, Baldwin said he believes the responsibility falls on Gutierrez Reed and assistant director Dave Halls, who handed him the gun. 
   
      However, Halls and Gutierrez Reed have repeatedly said they are not at fault and accuse Baldwin of attempting to shuffle off blame for the accident. 
   
      Gutierrez Reed maintains she did not know there were live rounds in the ammunition on set and has sued the film’s gun and ammunition supplier and its founder, who deny wrongdoing. She claims live rounds of ammunition were mixed into the dummy ammunition purchased from the company.
   
      Halls has signed a plea deal on a charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon, which grants him six months of probation and a suspended sentence, Carmack-Altwies’ office said.
   
      Hutchins’ family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Baldwin and others involved in the movie’s production, and reached an undisclosed settlement in the suit in October. 
   
      As part of the settlement agreement, Hutchins’ husband, Matthew Hutchins, was set to be an executive producer on “Rust” when it resumed filming.

      Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reflected on her husband Paul’s condition after the violent attack he suffered last year, saying that while he is “doing OK,” it will still “take a little while for him to be back to normal.” 
   
      Nancy Pelosi made the comments in an interview with CNN’s Chris Wallace on “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace,” which is now streaming on HBO Max and airs Sunday night at 7 p.m. ET on CNN. The California Democrat said that her husband is “very strong” but that the incident has been very “sad for our family” and that it’s a situation that has to be taken “one day at a time.” 
   
      Paul Pelosi was attacked in October with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco by a male assailant who was searching for the House speaker, according to court documents. Paul Pelosi had surgery “to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands,” a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi said in a statement following the incident. 
   
      “I feel very sad about it because of what happened, but also more sad because the person was searching for me,” Nancy Pelosi told Wallace. “My dear husband, who is not even that political actually, paid the price.”
   
      Paul Pelosi made his first public appearance after the brutal attack in December at the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, DC. 
   
      “He’s been out a bit because the doctor said he has to have something to look forward to, and so again, one day at a time,” Nancy Pelosi said. 
   
      Elaborating on her husband’s condition and recovery, she said, “He had wounds and all the rest in that on his body. Those took time, but they healed. Tendons, you know all that stuff. But the head is a different thing.”
   
      “Anyone who’s had a head injury knows that you have to be very careful,” the former speaker continued. “You have to be careful about movement. You have to be careful about light. You have to be careful about sound. And it just takes a while. You get very tired, but, you know, without going so further into it, but it takes, it will take probably another three or four months, according to the doctors, for him to be really himself.” 
   
      During the interview, Pelosi criticized the chaotic, contentious and drawn-out fight that played out on the House floor to elect Kevin McCarthy speaker now that Republicans have taken back control of the chamber. 
   
      “I was sad for the institution,” Pelosi said. “For the institution, they should have had their act together … and that was sad. It was nothing to be amused by or laugh at or anything. It was sad for the institution.”
   
      Pelosi saw clear differences in how she was able to lock in the votes to be elected speaker in 2019, and McCarthy’s election, which went to multiple ballots on the House floor as he struggled to secure the support needed from the GOP Conference before ultimately winning the gavel.
   
      “I wouldn’t ask people to go to the floor unless we had the votes. He knew what his, shall we say, obstacles were. They should have been resolved,” she said, referring to McCarthy.
   
      Pelosi also reacted to McCarthy’s vow to remove several Democratic lawmakers from key committee assignments. 
   
      McCarthy has argued that Democrats created a “new standard” when they were in the majority by removing GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona from their committees for inflammatory rhetoric and social media posts. McCarthy has said he would strip Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, both of California, and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota of their committee assignments.
   
      Asked if she opened the door to that, Pelosi pushed back, saying, “It was clear that their members were a threat to our members. So this is about maintaining safety for our members. The fact that they want to take these people off the committee is philosophical. So, they have the votes, they could take somebody off, but that’s for philosophical reasons. That’s not the precedent that we set.”
   
      Marking the end of an era for House Democrats, the caucus chose Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York as its leader to succeed Pelosi. That took place after Pelosi had announced that she would relinquish her leadership post, a role in which she built a legacy as one of the most powerful and polarizing figures in American politics. 
   
      With House Democrats now in the minority, Pelosi said that she doesn’t miss being speaker.
   
      “No. I sometimes wonder why I don’t, but I think that I’ve done my time,” she said. “I loved it. It was a great honor. Imagine, to be speaker of the House, second in line to the presidency, which of course, would never happen, but nonetheless, the prestige of it all. I love my members. I love the institution.”

      Grammy-winning rapper Young Thug and a racketeering co-defendant conducted a hand-to-hand drug transaction during a court hearing, prosecutors said in a motion filed in Atlanta.
   
      Fulton County prosecutors say the alleged exchange was captured on courtroom surveillance video Wednesday.
   
      The rapper, whose real name is Jeffery Lamar Williams, and Kahlieff Adams are charged with conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and participation in criminal street gang activity, among other charges.
   
      According to the motion seeking clarification of the record, Adams “stood up from his chair (…) and walked unattended” to Young Thug and gave him Percocet. 
   
      The motion said Young Thug tried to conceal his hand under the table. Sheriff’s deputies took the painkiller and searched Adams, who resisted. He was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital after “he appeared to ingest other items of contraband that he held on his person, in an effort to conceal the extent of his crimes within the courtroom.”  
   
      During the search of Adams, the deputies found Percocet, marijuana, tobacco, and other contraband, “wrapped in plastic and food seasonings to mask the odor of the marijuana,” the motion said.  
   
Percocet is the brand name of a drug that mixes oxycodone, which is an opioid, and acetaminophen, which is the generic name for drugs such as Tylenol.
   
      Keith Adams, one of Young Thug’s attorneys, told CNN on Friday, “The State is purposely misrepresenting and embellishing Wednesday’s events.”
   
      He said Young Thug neither requested nor accepted the pill.
   
      “As can be seen in the courtroom video footage, Mr. Williams IMMEDIATELY gave it to the courtroom deputy that was directly in front of him,” he wrote in a message.
   
      Adams said an investigation cleared Young Thug of any wrongdoing and the responsible party was charged. He said the prosecutors’ allegations were “a blatant fabrication and disappointing.”
   
      Teombre Calland, an attorney representing Kahlieff Adams, released a statement via text message to CNN affiliate WSB-TV saying: “On behalf of Mr. Adams, these allegations are simply that: mere statements made by the state in an effort to thwart the lengthiness of the jury selection process.”  
   
      CNN has reached out to Brian Steel, another Young Thug attorney, and Calland.    
   
      Young Thug won a Grammy Award in 2019 for his work with Childish Gambino and Ludwig Göransson on the hit song “This is America.” 
   
      The rapper was initially indicted in May on charges of conspiracy to violate the RICO Act and participation in criminal street gang activity.
   
      A re-indictment filed on August 5 in Fulton County Superior Court accuses him of nine new charges, including participating in criminal street gang activity and violating the Georgia Controlled Substances Act.
   
      He also was indicted on other charges of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and possession of a machine gun.
   
      Jury selection is ongoing.

      With egg prices rising, more people may be shopping for their own backyard chicken flock. 
   
      But before you build a coop and subscribe to Chicken Whisperer, health experts have a warning: Caring for backyard chickens is not as easy as bringing home a cute new kitten, and keeping chickens can come with a handful of serious health risks, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   
      You need to take extra precautions when handling the chickens and their eggs. 
   
      “Backyard poultry specifically can have salmonella germs in their poop and on their bodies, even when they look healthy and clean,” said Dr. Kathy Benedict, a veterinarian epidemiologist with the CDC.
   
      The bacteria can live on the bird’s beak, feathers or feet, as well as in their digestive tract, and can spread to the areas around where the birds live and onto a person’s clothes, hands or shoes. This can get the people around them sick. 
   
      Just over the past year, there have been several multistate salmonella outbreaks. Backyard flocks have been connected to at least 1,200 people getting sick with salmonella, Benedict said.  
   
      At least 225 people were hospitalized and there were two deaths connected to backyard poultry in 2022 alone.
 
      “That’s been happening over the last several years, at least a thousand cases have been reported each year,” Benedict said. “We expect that there’s many more than that that don’t necessarily get reported to public health.”
   
      Chickens can also expose people to the campylobacter bacteria. 
   
      Neither bacteria typically makes the bird sick, but both can cause diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps in people. 
   
      Benedict said people who have weakened immune systems, including people with diseases like cancer, diabetes, kidney or liver problems, as well as young children, need to take extra care around backyard chickens since they can experience more severe illness if they become infected.
   
      If you decide to get your own chickens, the CDC cautious parents to keep their children under the age of 5 from touching the animals. With older children, parents should supervise their interaction. The chicks may be cute, but little kids especially are much more likely to get sick with salmonella because their immune systems are still developing.  
   
      “Don’t kiss or snuggle your backyard poultry, don’t eat or drink around them,” Benedict advised. 
   
      Backyard birds and their accoutrement should stay in the backyard and out of the house to keep the bacteria confined to where the birds live.
   
      People may also want to keep “coop shoes” – shoes that you use exclusively when you interact with the chickens. Be sure to take them off before going back in the house, so you don’t track the bacteria inside. 
   
      Always wash your hands after touching the chickens or even keep hand sanitizer outside where you can disinfect your hands before going inside. 
   
      As far as handling the chicken’s eggs, people should collect them right away and not let them sit in the nest, since they can become dirty or break. Cracked eggs should be thrown away, since a crack can make it easy for bacteria to get inside. 
   
      Once the eggs are collected, if there’s any dirt, you should use a fine sandpaper, brush or cloth to wipe away the dirt. Don’t wash the eggs with water because colder water can pull the germs into the eggs. 
   
      The CDC recommends people refrigerate their eggs to keep them fresh. The cooler temperatures also slows the growth of the germs. 
   
      When you cook the eggs, make sure the yolk and the white are firm to again reduce your exposure to the bacteria.
   
      “At the CDC, we want to protect people’s health but we also understand that people have these close relationships with their chickens. We love this animal-human bond,” Benedict said. “There’s just a safe way to do it.”

      A young mother was clutching her 10-month-old son and running for safety when both were gunned down in a horrific attack that left six dead in a small central California community, the sheriff said.
   
      Forensic evidence shows a shooter stood over 16-year-old Alissa Parraz and her son Nycholas and shot both of them in the head, Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux said Tuesday during a news conference.
   
      “I know for a fact that this young lady was running for her life,” he said of the Monday attack that sent the teen fleeing a home where at least two suspects opened fire in a “cartel-like execution.” 
   
      “I’m not saying that this is a cartel, but also be clear that I am not eliminating that possibility,” Boudreaux said. “These people were clearly shot in the head, and they were also shot in places that the shooter would know that quick death would occur. This is also similar to high-ranking gang affiliations and the style of execution that they commit. 
   
      “So, we don’t if this is a gang-affiliated shooting, a cartel-affiliation or if the two are combined. But what we can tell you is the manner in which this has occurred is definitely one of the two, if not combined.”
   
      The massacre is one of 33 mass shootings in the US so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN tallies events in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. As of Wednesday, 17 children age 11 and younger died by gunshots so far this year while 26 suffered injuries, according to the archive. 
   
      The killings have shocked the Goshen community, the sheriff said, but he assured residents, “This was not a random act of violence. This was a very specific targeted act of violence. So, I don’t want the community to be scared or worried.”
   
      California authorities are searching for at least two suspects in Monday’s massacre and have offered a $10,000 reward for information that could lead to their arrest. Those with surveillance footage from the place and time of the massacre are asked to share it.
   
      The victims were targeted just before 3:40 a.m. at home in Goshen, California, a farming community about 30 miles southeast of Fresno, the sheriff said.
   
      The home was known to law enforcement for illegal activity, Boudreaux said.
   
      “But let me make this very clear: Not all these people in this home are gang members. And not all these people in this home are drug dealers. The 16-year-old female is an innocent victim. The grandmother inside appears to be an innocent victim. And definitely this 10-month-old child is an innocent victim,” he added. 
   
      The four other victims in Monday’s attack were identified as Marcos Parraz, 19; Eladio Parraz, 52; Alissa’s grandmother, Rosa Parraz, 72; and Jennifer Analla, 49, a close friend of a family member who survived. 
   
      Investigators have already collected hundreds of pieces of evidence from the crime scene, Boudreaux said during Tuesday’s news conference, adding detectives are working around the clock on forensics. 
   
      The three people who survived the shooting are relaying key details to authorities, he said.
   
      One survivor described hearing shots ring out in the home as he lay flat inside a room, pushing his feet against the door to keep it closed, Boudreaux said. He heard at least one of the shooters rattling the doorknob before they walked away. 
   
      “He was in such a state of fear that all he could do was hold the door, hoping that he was not the next victim,” Boudreaux said. 
   
      The two other survivors hid in a nearby trailer, where one of the victims was shot in the threshold of the trailer door, Boudreaux added. 
   
      “Fortunately, the two suspects in this case never entered that trailer. … So we have three surviving victims, who are providing a great deal of information,” he said.
   
      As authorities gather evidence, they can’t release everything they know because the suspects may be watching, the sheriff said.
   
      “We will be slow, methodical, accurate, precise … we will make sure that when we make these arrests that this investigation for the victims – these people will be held to justice,” he added. 
   
      Roughly two weeks before the shooting, deputies with the Tulare County Sheriff’s Office found shell casings outside the home on January 3 when they were attempting to conduct a parole compliance check, the office said in a news release emailed to CNN. 
   
      Compliance checks are done by law enforcement on people who are on felony parole to ensure they’re following the law, Boudreaux explained. 
   
      At the time, deputies asked to go inside the home but people at the house refused. Deputies returned with a warrant and found marijuana, methamphetamine, guns and body armor, according to the news release. 
   
      Eladio Parraz, one of the shooting victims, was arrested for being a felon in possession of ammunition, firearms and a controlled substance, the sheriff’s office said. He was released on bail four days later, the release said.

      Egypt’s economic situation is so dire that the government is asking people to eat chicken feet.  
   
      The Arab world’s most populous nation is suffering a record currency crisis and the worst inflation in five years, making food so expensive that many Egyptians can no longer afford chicken, a dietary staple.  
   
      Poultry prices rose from 30 Egyptian pounds (then $1.9) per kilogram in 2021 to as much as 70 Egyptian pounds ($2.36) as of Monday, according to state media.  
   
      The soaring cost has prompted the nation’s National Institution for Nutrition to call on people to switch to eating chicken feet.  
   
      “Are you looking for protein-rich food alternatives that will save your budget?” it asked in a Facebook post last month, listing a number of items starting with chicken feet and cattle hooves.   
   
      Many Egyptians are furious that the government would ask citizens to resort to foods that are symbols of extreme poverty in the country. In Egypt, chicken feet are seen as the cheapest of meat items, considered by most as animal waste rather than food.  
   
      “(We have entered) the age of chicken feet, the collapse of the Egyptian pound… and drowning in debt,” tweeted Mohamed Al-Hashimi, a media personality, to his 400,000 followers.   
   
      But others seem to be heeding the call. After the recommendation to switch to chicken feet, the price of one kilogram of the product reportedly doubled to 20 Egyptian pounds ($0.67).  
   
      Authorities say that close to 30% of Egypt’s population is below the poverty line. The World Bank in 2019 however estimated that “some 60% of Egypt’s population is either poor or vulnerable.”  
   
      Here’s what you need to know about Egypt’s spiraling economy:  
   
      Egypt has gone through a number of financial crises over the past decade, which forced it to seek bailouts from creditors like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Gulf Arab allies.   
   
      But the country has become trapped in a cycle of borrowing that analysts say has become unsustainable. Its debt this year amounts to 85.6% of the size of its economy, according to the IMF.   
   
      Some of the factors contributing to Egypt’s failing economy include the military’s outsized role, which analysts say weakens the private sector, as well as the allocation of great sums to mega projects like Africa’s tallest tower and a new capital city in the desert which houses a defense ministry that authorities boast is bigger than the Pentagon.  
   
      Egypt’s economy took a significant blow in the past two years when the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war squeezed its foreign currency reserves and rising fuel prices pushed inflation up.   
   
      The pandemic saw investors pull $20 billion from Egypt in 2020, and the economic fallout from the Ukraine war led to a similar amount leaving the country last year, according to Reuters.   
   
      “Twenty billion dollars is the equivalent of every penny Egypt has borrowed from the IMF since 2016, and it disappeared in weeks (last year),” said Timothy Kaldas, a non-resident policy fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington DC.  
   
      Those events contributed to the currency crisis Egypt faces today. The Egyptian pound lost almost half of its value over the past year, and last week briefly hit an exchange rate of 32 pounds to the US dollar, the lowest in its history.   
   
      In its latest bailout agreed in December, the IMF loaned $3 billion to Egypt, which it hopes will catalyze an additional $14 billion in support from Egypt’s international and regional partners, including oil-rich Gulf nations.  
   
      This year’s IMF loan was conditioned on Egypt implementing a number of structural reforms. And this time, the lender is taking on Egypt’s powerful military.  
   
      Along with introducing a flexible exchange rate – which would allow the value of the currency to be determined by the market instead of the central bank – the IMF also asked that Egypt reduce the role of the state, including the military, in the economy, and slow down national projects in order to limit pressures on the currency as well as inflation.   
   
      “What is exceptional about it is that it also encompasses Egypt’s military companies,” wrote Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, Lebanon. “This contradicts the initial impression given by the loan agreement announcement in October 2022, that the IMF had not used its leverage to place the military companies on the agenda.”   
   
      The IMF also demanded that all companies – including those owned by the military – publish an annual report “with details and estimates of tax exemptions and tax breaks.”  
   
      It remains to be seen whether these reports will ever be published. Kaldas says that many Egyptians want to know how wealthy the military is and also “the level of risk that Egypt’s military economic empire poses.”   
   
      “One of the challenges right now of understanding Egypt’s level of economic risk is we don’t know how much money military companies have borrowed,” he said.  
   
      The private sector in Egypt has been shrinking in the last seven years, according to Kaldas.  
   
      The S&P Global Egypt Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for December, which measures the health of Egypt’s non-oil private sector, showed a “solid deterioration,” remaining below the 50-mark needed for healthy economic growth for 25 consecutive months.  
   
      Egypt’s military owns and operates a significant number of companies which private enterprises struggle to compete with. From gas stations and pharmaceuticals to meat and dairy, military-owned companies make up a large proportion of Egypt’s economy.   
   
      But those firms don’t operate like private companies, enjoying special privileges without disclosing their financial data to the public.   
   
      The military also spearheads President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s vast national projects that critics say have sucked up much of Egypt’s funds.   
   
      Authorities have promised to list state-owned companies, including military-owned companies, on the stock exchange, a plan aimed at involving the private sector in their management. The plan is yet to be fully implemented, and analysts are skeptical about it given the secrecy with which these companies normally operate.   
   
      Sayigh of the Carnegie Middle East Center says the delay in getting military-owned companies listed on the stock exchange and having their finances disclosed is evidence of the military’s pushback against the conditions.   
   
      Experts have questioned why international creditors had not leveraged their loans to drive Egypt’s military out of the economy. The institution is a powerful one in Egypt, both financially and politically.   
   
      It was only with the military’s backing that Sisi was able to rise to power. The former field marshal was at the forefront of a 2013 military coup that overthrew former President Mohamed Morsy, the country’s only democratically elected president.   
   
Speaking to CNN’s Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi on Monday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said that state-owned enterprises “will be sold off to the private sector to encourage further investment” and that Egypt “is supported by the IMF in this regard.”  
   
      Asked how soon the government would review the military’s involvement in the economy, Shoukry said that Egypt is dealing with the challenges in a “holistic manner” while also “recognizing the social dimension” at the heart of the country’s financial woes.   
   
      Kaldas of the Tahrir Institute said that there are ways for the government to circumvent the IMF’s conditions by making changes that seem like compromises but don’t change the structure of the economy.  
   
      “If everything in this agreement is actually followed, it is almost certain that there would be a reduced role (for the military in Egypt),” he said.  
   
      When Egypt devalued its currency in October, the US embassy in Cairo issued a “demonstration alert,” warning of potential unrest.   
   
      More than a decade ago, Egypt and other Middle Eastern states slipped into a wave of protests that toppled governments, stunted economies, and even triggered civil wars that drove millions of refugees to flee the region.   
   
      In 2011, when millions took to the streets demanding changes of regime, the most commonly chanted slogan in Egypt was “Bread, freedom and social equality.”  
   
      Egypt is home to more than 106 million people, more than half of whom are living in precarious economic conditions. Many are unable to afford basic food staples, limiting their spending and even restricting diets, and analysts have warned of unrest should the situation deteriorate significantly.   
   
Hamas releases purported first video of Israeli hostage since 2014 capture 
 
      Hamas on Monday released a video it claims is of Avera Mengistu, an Israeli man who has been held prisoner in Gaza by the Palestinian militant group since he crossed into the coastal enclave in 2014. The video is undated and appears to show Mengistu sitting in a buttoned-up purple shirt against a white wall, asking how long he will remain in captivity and where his country is. He appears for about 11 seconds. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the video or confirm when it was filmed. It is likely that Mengistu made the statement under duress. Mengistu’s mother Agernish told Channel 12 she was sure it was her son.

US partnership is crucial for global security, says Saudi envoy 
 
      Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the United States said on Wednesday that maintaining the long-standing strategic partnership between Riyadh and Washington was “beyond critically necessary” for global stability, Reuters reported. “Yes there was a moment of conflict and disagreement, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that we are both strategic allies and we are friends, and this relationship is critical for the world,” Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. 
   
      Investment in hydrocarbons is needed to keep oil prices low as the world transitions to clean energy, UAE Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told CNN’s Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi.  
   
      The minister said that controlling the rise in oil prices during the transition is necessary, especially since there is no system in place to totally compensate for hydrocarbons.  
   
      The UAE, he said, brought forward its target to raise output capacity to 2027 from 2030 in order to avoid market volatility. 
   
      “You need to juggle the three challenges: sustainability, security of supply and affordability,” he said.  
   
      The UAE has been arguing against divestment from fossil fuels in an effort to reduce emissions. “We need to fight the emissions, not the fuel,” he said.

      A Saudi Arabian businessman has won an auction for a golden ticket to watch Cristiano Ronaldo take on Lionel Messi with a bid of 10 million Saudi riyals ($2.6 million). 
   
      The chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Entertainment (GEA), Turki Al Sheikh, said Tuesday that businessman Mushref Al-Ghamdi, the general manager of real estate group AqarOne, was the winning bidder for the “Beyond Imagination” ticket, which gets the holder a seat at Paris Saint-Germain’s friendly match against a team comprised of players from Saudi teams Al Hilal and Al Nassr, the club that recently signed Ronaldo. 
   
      According to a video posted to Al Sheikh’s Twitter account, the winning bidder will get to attend the opening ceremony, watch the match next to the GEA chairman and have the chance to meet Ronaldo and Messi as well as the Argentine’s fellow PSG stars, Neymar Jr. and Kylian Mbappé. 
   
      Al Sheikh said the money from the winning bid will go to Saudi charity Ehsan.

New Kids on the Block star Jonathan Knight has revealed that he was pressured into hiding his sexuality during the band’s early days. 
   
      Knight, now 54, said that the band’s manager at the time knew that he was gay, but urged him to keep his sexuality a secret. 
   
      One fifth of the Massachusetts-based boy band, Knight revealed last year that he had married his longtime partner, Harley Rodriguez. 
   
      But much has changed since he and his bandmates –  his brother Jordan Knight, Donnie Wahlberg, Danny Wood and Joey McIntyre – shot to fame in the 1980s. 
   
      Speaking to Frosted Tips, a podcast hosted by former NSYNC member Lance Bass, Knight said of the group’s manager: “He pulled me aside and he was like ‘if anybody finds out then your career is over, the New Kids’ career is over,’ my manager said, ‘my career is over … Sony’s going to, like, lose money.’” 
   
      “It was just so much pressure,” he added. “Looking back, that’s a lot of pressure to put on somebody who is just trying to figure out the world themselves.
   
      He recalled being the first to leave the band in 1994, saying: “Pop music was just not what it used to be and you know we went from arenas down to theaters and then eventually I left the New Kids and they continued on and they were doing nightclubs. And it just kept going down and down but I had jumped out early. 
   
      “There were a few reasons. Number one, being a young gay kid I was frustrated and wanted to get on with my own life. The other reason, it just felt like it was not going anywhere and I just wanted to be home.”
   
      The group officially disbanded soon after and only reunited in 2008. 
   
      “Even when we got back together I still wasn’t out publicly,” he told Bass. “It was a boyfriend of mine that sold pictures of us to the National Enquirer.”
   
      He described the process as “horrible,” but welcomed the fact that so much has changed in recent years. 
   
      “Even the way people come out now has changed,” he said. “People will be doing an award show and just be like ‘I’d like to thank my husband blah blah blah…’ and nobody flinches.”
   
      Bass, who became a father to twins with his husband, Michael Turchin, in 2021, also brought up changing attitudes to parenthood within the gay community. 
   
      Knight said that “95%” of his and Rodriguez’s gay friends are now parents, but that the process was not straightforward for them. 
   
      “We tried and we went through the journey for about five years and it just didn’t happen for us,” said Knight. “Going through the process is like ‘today’s the day, the eggs are being implanted.’ You’re so excited and you’re so happy and then a week later it’s like no, you’re back to square one.”
   
      Knight spoke about his second career as a presenter on TV renovation show “Farmhouse Fixer,” as well as the band’s appearance on cruises in recent years.

Regal Cinemas is closing 39 more movie theaters across the United States.
   
      The decision comes four months after its parent company Cineworld filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after the pandemic devastated the industry and public screenings. 
   
      In a filing this week, Cineworld said it is planning to reject leases for the 39 theaters beginning February 15, saving the company $22 million annually.
   
      Cineworld is working with landlords to keep its other theaters open. Around 500 remain, after these closures and a previous round in September 2022 that shuttered 12 locations.
   
      “The debtors are hopeful that these negotiations will lead to lease concessions and modifications that will obviate the need for rejection and enable additional theater sites to remain open,” Cineworld said in this week’s filing.
   
      When Cineworld announced its decision to file for bankruptcy last year, the company said it wanted to shed debt. It expects filing for bankruptcy will “strengthen its balance sheet and provide the financial strength and flexibility to accelerate, and capitalize on, Cineworld’s strategy in the cinema industry.”
   
      Regal Cinemas is the United States’ second-largest theater chain after AMC Theaters, which has 950 locations according to its website.

      It’s the end of another long day at the office after a poor night’s sleep. As usual, you’re exhausted, yet you want to stop at the gym on the way home to get the exercise you need to stay healthy.
   
      Should you work out when you are suffering from chronic sleep loss?
   
      This conundrum is a widespread problem, considering 1 in 3 Americans are sleep deprived, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
   
      “It is definitely a bidirectional relationship, not one or the other,” said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.
   
      “First, there is clear data to show that regular exercise improves sleep quality — moderate exercise in the morning, afternoon or very early evening can improve deep sleep,” Zee said.
   
      Deep sleep is the healing stage in which your body repairs and restores itself. Also called “slow wave” sleep, it can only be achieved if your sleep quality is good, with few to no nighttime interruptions.
   
      “Research also shows that if you sleep better, you’re more likely to be able to engage in exercise and your physical activity levels are going to be higher,” Zee said. 
   
      “So I would say that even if you have had a bad night’s sleep, you should maintain your physical activity.” 
   
      To be healthy, the body needs to move through four stages of sleep several times each night. During the first and second stages, the body starts to decrease its rhythms. Doing so prepares us for the third stage — a deep, slow-wave sleep where the body is literally restoring itself on a cellular level, fixing damage from the day’s wear and tear and consolidating memories into long-term storage.
   
      Rapid eye movement sleep, called REM, is the final stage in which we dream. Studies have shown that missing REM sleep may lead to memory deficit and poor cognitive outcomes as well as heart and other chronic diseases and an early death.
   
      On the flip side, years of research has found sleep, especially the deepest, most healing kind, boosts immune functioning.
 
      Since each sleep cycle is roughly 90 minutes long, most adults need seven to eight hours of relatively uninterrupted slumber to achieve restorative sleep and be healthy, according to the CDC. Sleep debt, along with irregular sleep duration, has been linked to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, dementia and mood disorders such as anxiety and depression.
   
      One night of poor sleep shouldn’t have to impact your workout routine, but chronic sleep deprivation leading to multiple days of exhaustion is another matter, experts say.
   
      It may not be wise to hit the gym or play a sport when you’re barely putting one foot in front of the other, said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine.
   
      “Without sleep, your muscles can’t recover from the stress you put them through during workouts. It doesn’t do you much good to keep breaking down your muscles without giving them time to recover and grow stronger,” Dasgupta said.
   
      In addition, you’re more likely to suffer an injury when you’re exhausted, he explained, due to slowed reaction times from your tired brain working to make decisions during the workout or sport. 
   
      “Poor sleep can also affect your motivation to exercise in the first place. You might find yourself dreading your normal workouts and hating every minute in the gym, which is not good for long-term adherence to a fitness plan,” Dasgupta said. 
   
      In addition, sleep deprivation can lead you to make poor food choices, which affect your fitness and physical performance, he said.
   
      So it’s not a good idea to work out while extremely tired, but you will also sleep better and get more out of exercise if you do. What’s the answer?
   
      Use common sense, Zee said. “If you’re not sleeping well, don’t go for that intense workout, right? Walk or do yoga instead, but certainly maintain an exercise or physical activity regimen at the regular time of the day that you normally would be doing it.”
   
      If you’re pressed for time, consider fitting in several short bouts of exercise throughout your day. 
   
      “Everything counts,” Dasgupta said. “Do anything that makes you feel happy and refreshed. This is about hitting the reset button for yourself, not doing some form of exercise because you feel obligated to.”

      Brazilian footballer Dani Alves has been detained by police in Barcelona in relation to an investigation for an alleged sexual assault, a spokesperson for Catalan’s regional police told CNN on Friday.
   
      According to the police spokesperson, Alves was at a police station in Barcelona on Friday morning, which he later left as a “detainee.”
   
      Alves, one of the most decorated football players of his generation, was driven in a police car from the station to a court in Barcelona’s “City of Justice,” where he will appear in front of a judge later on Friday, the spokesperson said.
   
      CNN’s calls to Alves’ representatives have not been immediately returned. 
   
      Earlier this month, a spokesman told Reuters that Alves “vehemently denies” all of the allegations.  
   
      The Catalonia Higher Court of Justice confirmed on January 10 that Alves is under investigation for an alleged sexual assault that took place at a Barcelona night club last month.
   
      In a video sent to Spanish channel Antena 3, Alves said he was at the night club but denied the allegations. 
   
      “I want to deny everything, first. I was there, in that location, I was there with more people, having a good time,” he said. 
   
      “I am very sorry, but I don’t know who this lady is,” he also said.
   
      Alves has won domestic titles in Spain, Italy and France. He also won three Champions League titles with Barcelona.

      The US Department of Justice is investigating Abbott Laboratories infant-formula plant in Sturgis, Michigan, a spokesperson for the company confirmed to CNN.
   
      “The DOJ has informed us of its investigation and we’re cooperating fully,” the statement emailed to CNN said.
   
      The investigation was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
   
      The plant was shut down for months last year after a US Food and Drug Administration inspection found Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria, which can be deadly to infants, in several areas. 
   
      Similac, Alimentum and EleCare powdered infant formulas made at the plant were recalled, and the closure exacerbated an infant formula shortage that caused problems for families across the country.
   
      After being closed for months, Abbott’s Sturgis plant reopened in June with production of EleCare specialty formula. Production had been underway for less than two weeks before a storm and flooding prompted officials to close the plant again. It was restarted in July.
   
      In April, Abbott submitted a corrective action plan to the FDA. In May, a federal judge signed off on an agreement between the FDA and Abbott that laid out the steps the company needed to take to restart production. 
   
      “We understand the urgent need for formula and our top priority is getting high-quality, safe formula into the hands of families across America,” Abbott said in its statement at the time. “We will ramp production as quickly as we can while meeting all requirements. We’re committed to safety and quality and will do everything we can to re-earn the trust parents, caregivers and health care providers have placed in us for 130 years.”
   
      President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to direct suppliers of formula ingredients to prioritize delivery to formula makers. The administration also created Operation Fly Formula to import formula from abroad.

      The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is ironing out the “logistical and legal” aspects of testing wastewater from airplanes for coronavirus variants as it continues to explore such an infectious disease monitoring program.
   
      The agency is still “figuring out how to operationalize this program,” a person close to CDC discussions said, adding that there are “logistical and legal” hurdles that need to be sorted out before the program “would be operational.”
   
      Some of the agency’s partners tell CNN that they are poised to help roll out this potential next frontier in the nation’s Covid-19 surveillance effort.
   
      Monitoring sewage for traces of coronavirus variants is a “validated” scientific process – no longer in its pilot phase – and airplanes are a logical next step, said Matt McKnight, general manager at Boston-based synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks. Its Concentric by Ginkgo biosecurity and public health unit has been chosen to partner in the CDC’s traveler-based genomic surveillance program to detect Covid-19 and flu variants among international travelers.
   
      For now, the use of testing services to collect and analyze airplane wastewater for variants “is an active conversation between CDC, the White House and the airlines,” McKnight said.
   
      But the process of testing airplane wastewater itself is “validated methodology, and it is a program that can be run actively,” he added. “The system is ready to go.”
   
      Testing aircraft wastewater involves collecting sewage from individual passenger-carrying commercial airplanes.
   
      “You can pull it off the airplane in under two minutes, quickly put it into a lab network, which we manage all of that,” McKnight said.
   
      Once those wastewater samples arrive at a diagnostic lab for testing, scientists scan them for traces of known or unknown viruses, such as emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. When samples test positive for the virus, scientists conduct genome sequencing to identify exactly which variant that virus is.
   
      “Usually, sequencing takes about five to seven days,” said Casandra Philipson, a researcher and program lead for Ginkgo Bioworks. Then, scientists may analyze their results and submit their findings to the CDC.
   
      “We can do analysis really quickly,” Philipson said, such as in a few days. “And then return results immediately.”
   
      Both McKnight and Philipson said that airplane wastewater surveillance not only can help with detecting emerging coronavirus and influenza variants – serving as a “radar system” – it can alert vaccine makers to which variants our Covid-19 shots might need to target each year. 
   
      Advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration are scheduled to meet this week to discuss Covid-19 vaccines becoming annual immunizations, similar to the seasonal flu vaccine.
   
      That process could include streamlining the vaccine composition, immunization schedules and periodic updates of vaccines, according to meeting documents posted Monday. The FDA has said it expects to assess circulating strains of the coronavirus at least annually and decide in June which strains to select for the fall season, similar to the process of updating annual flu vaccines.
   
      “If you give Moderna or Pfizer information early enough, they can make a vaccine really quickly, which we couldn’t do at the beginning of the pandemic,” McKnight said. “The big lesson learned is that you can think about all of these variants of viruses circulating around the world, and it’s kind of like anything else we would have a radar system for, to detect what is out there so you can get an early warning.”
   
      A report released last week by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine describes wastewater surveillance as a “valuable component” of infectious disease management and notes that wastewater surveillance at major US airports and ports of entry could help identify initial cases for pathogens from other regions among international travelers. The report was produced at the request of the CDC.
   
      A separate study conducted in the United Kingdom, published last week in the journal Plos Global Health, found that the majority of 150 wastewater samples collected from terminals and additional samples from 32 aircraft at three major international airports in the UK in March 2022 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The data included three terminals total – one at each airport.
   
      All samples taken from sewers at the arrival terminals of Heathrow and Bristol airports, and 85% of samples taken from sites at Edinburgh airport, were positive for the virus, according to the study.
   
      “I was not surprised that we found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in those wastewater samples. This was a proof-of-concept study: being able to detect the viral RNA in the samples proved that our methodology works, which was a positive outcome,” Kata Farkas, an author of the study and researcher at Bangor University in the UK, said in an email Tuesday.
   
      “In our study, we used PCR-based detection, but other studies have utilised sequencing successfully for these types of samples. Therefore, variants can also be identified in aircraft/airport wastewater, supporting other types of surveillance programmes to better understand which variants are circulating globally,” she wrote. “It is worth noting that the methodology we described can be used for the identification of other viruses that may threaten global public health.”

      The historic center of the Ukrainian port city of Odesa and sites in Yemen and Lebanon were added to the World Heritage List Wednesday by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
   
      All three sites were simultaneously added to UNESCO’s List of World Heritage in Danger.
   
      UNESCO’s founding Convention obliges all members – among whom are Russia and Ukraine – to “not take any deliberate measures that directly or indirectly damage their heritage or that of another State Party to the Convention.”
   
      Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO, said in a statement that he hoped the listing would help protect Odesa from the war. 
   
      “Odesa, a free city, a world city, a legendary port that has left its mark on cinema, literature and the arts, is thus placed under the reinforced protection of the international community,” Azoulay said. 
   
      “While the war continues, this inscription embodies our collective determination to ensure that this city, which has always surmounted global upheavals, is preserved from further destruction.” 
   
      The statement said that the decision would give Ukraine access to “technical and financial international assistance” to protect and rehabilitate the city center.
   
      The inscription was made during an extraordinary session of the World Heritage Committee in Paris.
   
      The meeting addressed three threatened sites:
   
• Historic Center of Odesa (Ukraine)• Rachid Karami International Fair-Tripoli (Lebanon)• Landmarks of the Ancient Kingdom of Saba in Marib Governorate (Yemen)
   
      All three are now listed on both the World Heritage List and the List of World Heritage in Danger.
   
      In Yemen, the site includes seven archaeological sites that show the architectural, aesthetic and technological achievements of the Kingdom of Saba from the 1st millennium BCE to the arrival of Islam around 630 CE.
   
      The site was added to the “in danger” list due to threats posed to the site from the ongoing conflict in Yemen.
   
      The site in Lebanon, Rachid Karami International Fair in Tripoli, was designed in 1962 by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. Its main building is a boomerang-shaped covered exhibition hall.
   
      “It is one of the major representative works of 20th-century modern architecture in the Arab Near East,” UNESCO said in a news release.
   
      It was added to the threatened list due to its “alarming state of conservation, the lack of financial resources for its maintenance, and the latent risk of development proposals that could affect the integrity of the complex,” UNESCO said.

      California voters will decide next year on a referendum that could overturn a landmark new state law setting worker conditions and minimum wages up to $22 an hour for fast-food employees in the nation’s largest state.
   
      Chipotle, Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s, In-N-Out Burger and KFC-owner Yum! Brands each donated $1 million to Save Local Restaurants, a coalition opposing the law. Other top fast-food companies, business groups, franchise owners, and many small restaurants also have criticized the legislation and spent millions of dollars opposing it.
   
      The measure, known as the FAST Act, was signed last year by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and was set to go into effect on January 1. On Tuesday, California’s secretary of state announced that a petition to stop the law’s implementation had gathered enough signatures to quality for a vote on the state’s 2024 general election ballot.
   
      The closely-watched initiative could transform the fast-food industry in California and serve as a bellwether for similar policies in other parts of the country, proponents and critics of the measure argued.
   
      The law is the first of its kind in the United States, and authorized the formation of a 10-member Fast Food Council comprised of labor, employer and government representatives to oversee standards for workers in the state’s fast-food industry. 
   
      The council had the authority to set sector-wide minimum standards for wages, health and safety protections, time-off policies, and worker retaliation remedies at fast-food restaurants with more than 100 locations nationally. 
   
      The council could raise the fast-food industry minimum wage as high as $22 an hour, versus a $15.50 minimum for the rest of the state. From there, that minimum would rise annually based on inflation.
   
      California’s fast-food industry has more than 550,000 workers. Nearly 80% are people of color and around 65% are women, according to the Service Employees International Union, which has backed the law and the Fight for $15 movement. 
   
      Advocates of the law, including unions and labor groups, see this as a breakthrough model to improve pay and conditions for fast-food workers and overcome obstacles unionizing workers in the industry. They argue that success in California may lead other labor-friendly cities and states to adopt similar councils regulating fast-food and other service industries. Less than 4% of restaurant workers nationwide are unionized. 
   
      Labor law in the United States is structured around unions that organize and bargain at an individual store or plant. This makes it nearly impossible to organize workers at fast-food and retail chains with thousands of stores. 
   
      California’s law would bring the state closer to sectoral bargaining, a form of collective bargaining where labor and employers negotiate wages and standards across an entire industry.
   
      Opponents of the law say it’s a radical measure that would have damaging effects. They argue it unfairly targets the fast-food industry and will increase prices and force businesses to lay off workers, citing an analysis by economists at UC Riverside which found that if restaurant worker compensation increases by 20%, restaurant prices would increase by approximately 7%. If restaurant worker compensation increased by 60%, limited-service restaurant prices would jump by up to 22%, the study also found.
   
      “This law creates a food tax on consumers, kills jobs, and pushes restaurants out of local communities,” said the Save Local Restaurants coalition. 
   
      On Wednesday, McDonald’s US President Joe Erlinger blasted the law as one driven by struggling unions that would lead to “an unelected council of political insiders, not local business owners and their teams,” making key business decisions. 
   
      Opponents have turned to a similar strategy used by Uber, Lyft and gig companies that sought to overturn a 2020 California law that would have required them to reclassify drivers as employees, and not “independent contractors,” which would provide them with benefits such as a minimum wage, overtime, and paid sick leave.
   
      In 2020, Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and others spent more than $200 million to successfully persuade California voters to pass Proposition 22, a ballot measure that exempted the companies from reclassifying their workers as employees.

      She has survived the horrors of two world wars, a civil war and two global pandemics.
   
      Now US-born Maria Branyas Morera has been named the world’s oldest person by Guinness World Records (GWR), following the death of French nun Sister André earlier this month aged 118. 
   
      Morera has spent the last 22 years in a nursing home in Catalonia, Spain, but she was born almost 116 years ago thousands of miles away in San Francisco. 
   
      Her birth on March 4, 1907 came less than four years after the Wright Brothers launched the first ever power driven flight and two years before construction had even begun on the ill-fated Titanic.
   
      Despite being just weeks away from her 116th birthday, Morera even uses Twitter – with a little help from her daughter – to communicate with her thousands of followers. 
   
      “I am old, very old, but not an idiot,” her Twitter bio reads.
   
      Morera was born a year after her parents emigrated to the US. Eight years later, the family moved back but the journey proved to be a treacherous one. 
   
      Morera’s father died of pulmonary tuberculosis toward the end of the transatlantic voyage, while she permanently lost her hearing in one ear after a fall, according to GWR.
   
      The family arrived in Barcelona during World War I and Morera’s life has also spanned the Spanish Civil War and World War II. 
   
      She is believed to be among the oldest people to have recovered from Covid-19, having tested positive for the virus in May 2020.
   
      In a series of tweets in Catalan on Saturday, Morera, who has three children, 11 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren, said she was “surprised and grateful” for the interest generated by her new status but that the last few days had been “stressful” and she would not be giving any more interviews.
   
      “I need peace and tranquility,” she tweeted. “I have lived in the Tura Residence for 22 years and I do not want the day-to-day life of the residents or the staff who take care of us to change.”
   
      When news of Morera’s record first emerged, the Residència Santa María del Tura issued a statement to GWR saying: “To celebrate this very special event we will have a small celebration behind closed doors in the residence in the coming days.”
   
      The title of the oldest person ever recorded belongs to Jeanne Louise Calment. Born on February 21, 1875, her life spanned 122 years and 164 days, according to GWR.

      Eighteen months ago, I woke up in the cardiac intensive care unit of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. “What happened?” I repeatedly asked the clinicians taking care of me as my brain struggled to process how I had gone from a dinner with friends to being on a ventilator in a hospital.
   
      I had experienced cardiac arrest in which a major artery supplying blood to my heart had suddenly become blocked and caused ventricular fibrillation, an arrhythmia that is typically fatal.
   
      Like the NFL player Damar Hamlin who recently experienced cardiac arrest during a Monday Night Football game, my odds of survival were enhanced by several factors. When I collapsed without warning, I was with people who recognized I didn’t have a pulse and started CPR immediately. 
   
      The restaurant where I was eating did not have a defibrillator, but Cincinnati emergency medical services arrived in less than five minutes and used a defibrillator and medications to jump-start my heart. I was fortunate to be near a major university hospital with highly skilled personnel (the same hospital that initially treated Hamlin). 
   
      Within 23 minutes of my cardiac arrest, I was in the University of Cincinnati emergency room and soon transported to the cardiac catheterization lab, where the medical team opened my blocked artery. Four days later, I walked out of the hospital.
   
      Since then, I have thought often about what happened and how lucky I was. Some people have a cardiac arrest that is unwitnessed. Others are not with people who know how to perform CPR or have access to a defibrillator. Without CPR, the brain is damaged within three to four minutes. Sometimes EMS isn’t able to arrive quickly enough to prevent irreversible brain damage or death. 
   
      About 1,000 Americans a day have cardiac arrest outside of hospital settings, according to the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation, and survival rates are about 10%, the American Heart Association says. In contrast, in Europe, the percentage of people who have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and survive to be discharged from a hospital after treatment is 11.7%; in Oceania, it’s 16.2%, though in Asia it is alarmingly just 4.5%, according to data published in 2020 in the journal Critical Care.
 
      Why are survival rates so low? Why can’t the US, a country with arguably the most advanced medical system in the world, do better?
   
      Breakdowns at any point of what’s known as the chain of survival mapped out by the American Heart Association create a high risk of a cardiac arrest being fatal. Recognition of cardiac arrest and activation of EMS is the first step, followed by immediate initiation of CPR and rapid defibrillation. The rate of CPR initiation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests is only about 40%. The time it takes EMS to arrive varies greatly across the country in accordance with distance, traffic and resources. 
   
      Few private homes have automated external defibrillators, or AEDs, and many public locations do not have them. A bystander uses an AED in less than 10% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, according to the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. Unlike countries such as Sweden, there is no national registry in which you can quickly locate the nearest AED, so you could be near one and not even know it.  
   
      We could, however, make significant progress in strengthening each of the links in the chain of survival. Much of doing so requires no specialized knowledge or training. 
   
      Each of us can sign up for an American Heart Association CPR training course that teaches the basics of CPR, how to confirm whether someone has a pulse, how to activate EMS and how to use a defibrillator.
   
      An AED tells you exactly where to put the paddles on someone’s chest and when to push the buttons. While 40 states and the District of Columbia require CPR training before high school graduation, according to the American Heart Association, periodic refreshing is helpful so that people feel confident doing CPR and using an AED. 
   
      As the cost of an AED has declined to less than $1,500, consideration should be given to expecting retail establishments and organizations above a certain size to have at least one. Some states require 911 operators to know how to assist in CPR by phone, but universal training nationwide would allow all operators to assist bystanders in providing life-saving care, no matter where a cardiac arrest occurs. 
   
      Only about half of the US participates in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES), the only national registry that collects data on treatments and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Full participation would be an important vehicle for improving quality of treatment and helping other parts of the country approach Seattle’s exceptional resuscitation rate; in 2021, Seattle had about a 16% survival rate for those treated by EMS after a cardiac arrest, two to three times higher than many other communities.
   
      Many of us watched with great concern and then excitement as Hamlin went from needing nine minutes of CPR on the field of an NFL game to walking out of the hospital more than a week later. 
 
      He was fortunate to have about 30 medical personnel nearby when he experienced cardiac arrest. However, survival statistics improve greatly if just one person is with you who activates EMS and starts CPR right away. 
   
      Signing up for a CPR course, advocating for greater defibrillator access, training people in telecommunicator CPR use and participating in the CARES registry will improve survival chances for people in your community who experience cardiac arrest.

      Over the holidays, while most media executives were perhaps looking to get a reprieve from work, Jonah Peretti was online, fully immersed in experimenting with artificial intelligence.
   
      The BuzzFeed co-founder and chief executive, who has always raced to test out the latest technologies, was familiar with AI and predictions of how it could one day revolutionize the media industry. In fact, BuzzFeed had dabbled in using it over the years.
   
A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
 
      But Peretti, sitting in his California home in late December, started probing how the developing robot writing technology could quickly be infused into the very DNA of BuzzFeed. 
   
      In a phone interview Thursday, Peretti said that as he and a handful of colleagues prototyped how the technology could be used to enhance the site’s hallmark quizzes, interactive articles, and other types of content, he found himself genuinely having fun. “It started to feel like we were all playing,” Peretti recalled.
   
      That “playful work,” as he described it, soon “led to multiple Google docs full of the implications of the technology and how [BuzzFeed] could build this into our platform and how we could extend it to other formats.” 
   
      Those efforts culminated in Peretti’s formal announcement on Thursday: That BuzzFeed will work with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to assist in the creation of content for its audience and move artificial intelligence into the “core business.” 
   
      Peretti said that he understood people might read the news and conclude that BuzzFeed was, in short, moving to replace humans with robots. But Peretti insisted that is not his vision for the technology, even as he predicted other companies will likely go down that dark path. 
   
      “I think that there are two paths for AI in digital media,” Peretti said. “One path is the obvious path that a lot of people will do — but it’s a depressing path — using the technology for cost savings and spamming out a bunch of SEO articles that are lower quality than what a journalist could do, but a tenth of the cost. That’s one vision, but to me, that’s a depressing vision and a shortsighted vision because in the long run it’s not going to work.” 
   
      “The other path,” Peretti continued, “which is the one that gets me really excited, is the new model for digital media that is more personalized, more creative, more dynamic — where really talented people who work at our company are able to use AI together and entertain and personalize more than you could ever do without AI.” 
   
      Put more simply, Peretti said he envisions artificial intelligence being used to enhance the work of his employees, not replace them.
   
      The example the company provided is the BuzzFeed quiz. Typically, a human would write the questions and perhaps a dozen responses that would be delivered to the user based on their inputs. But, with AI, the staffer could write the questions and the software could spit out a highly personalized response for the user. In the supplied example, a user would take a quick quiz and the AI would write a short RomCom using the data provided. 
   
      “We don’t have to train the AI to be as good as the BuzzFeed writers because we have the BuzzFeed writers, so they can inject language, ideas, cultural currency and write them into prompts and the format,” Peretti said. “And then the AI pulls it together and creates a new piece of content.” 
   
      Peretti indicated that he had no interest in utilizing artificial intelligence to replace human journalists for authoring news articles, as the technology outlet CNET recently did with disastrous consequences (dozens of the outlet’s stories written by AI were riddled with errors that required correcting.)
   
      “There’s the CNET path, and then there is the path that BuzzFeed is focused on,” Peretti said. “One is about costs and volume of content, and one is about ability.”
   
      “Even if there are a lot of bad actors who try to use AI to make content farms, it won’t win in the long run,” Peretti predicted. “I think the content farm model of AI will feel very depressing and dystopian.”

      Maggie Musgrave was sitting, alone, in Miami International Airport, crying.
   
      It was a Sunday evening in summer 2011. Thunderstorms were raging over Miami, and the airport departure area was getting increasingly crowded, with stranded travelers fighting for seats as plane after plane was grounded.
   
      Maggie, then 28, was on her way home to Washington DC after spending the weekend in Florida at her bachelorette party. While she was grateful to her friends for organizing a fun few days’ celebrations, now the hangover was kicking in and something worse was lingering underneath: Maggie had a sinking feeling that her upcoming wedding was a huge mistake. 
   
      “I was thinking I was making the wrong decision getting married,” Maggie tells CNN Travel today. “I remember being in the airport and thinking, ‘Oh, goodness, I don’t know if this is the right move.’ And being really emotional.”
   
      As she wiped away tears, Maggie heard the sound of barking. She looked up to see an excitable dog lapping at her knees.
   
      “I was like, ‘Oh gosh, I could really use a pet from this dog,’” Maggie recalls. She greeted the animal enthusiastically, giving him a belly rub.
   
      Right behind the dog was a woman – seemingly his owner – rushing up to apologize.
   
      “Oh hi, I’m sorry!” said the stranger. 
   
      “No it’s fine, it’s fine,” said Maggie, still petting the dog, who was now licking her hand happily.
   
      “I’m Cindy,” said the woman. “He’s Deniro,” she added, gesturing to her dog.
   
      “Like Robert?” asked Maggie. 
   
      Cindy explained that yes, her dog was named for actor Robert De Niro - she’d grown up loving “The Godfather” movies. Maggie told Cindy she also had a dog with a cinematic namesake: Scarlett O’Hara, after the protagonist of “Gone With the Wind.” 
   
      Instantaneously, the two women established an easy rapport. Maggie and Cindy were the same age, both dog lovers, both film fans. And they were both waiting for the same grounded flight back home to Washington DC.
   
      “We hit it off immediately,” Cindy tells CNN Travel today. 
   
      When Cindy crossed paths with Maggie at the airport, she was also questioning some of her life choices. Cindy was working a job she hated, desperate to leave but worried that finding something new wouldn’t be easy. She’d earned her Master’s degree in the middle of the recession, and jobs still felt sparse.
   
      “I actually had this desperation – ‘What’s my future going to look like?’” Cindy recalls. 
   
      Maggie and Cindy chatted as they waited for their flight, both women finding solace in one another’s company.
   
      Cindy had noticed Maggie’s tears – “she collected herself when I approached to grab Deniro,” she recalls – but didn’t press for details on what was going on.
   
      “I did not want to seem too intrusive. I figured if we talk it will get her mind off of things,” Cindy recalls.
   
      Sure enough, Maggie found chatting to Cindy, who was open, friendly and exuded kindness, a welcome distraction from her worries about the upcoming wedding. Plus, Deniro the dog was charming and sweet, offering comfort and cuddles. 
   
      And when Cindy mentioned the issues with her job, Maggie told her she might be able to help Cindy start over. She worked as a recruiter at a staffing agency – finding people the perfect role was her job.
   
      The two women spent over an hour deep in conversation. And when the flight was eventually called, they swapped details – promising to get back in touch when they were home in DC.
   
      “I just met this really wonderful girl,” Cindy told her boyfriend when he picked her up at Ronald Reagan National Airport.
   
      Maggie also gushed about her new friend to her then-fiancé, although she left out the context.
   
      “I did not tell him that I was crying, when I met her, about not wanting to marry him.”
   
      Back in DC, Maggie and Cindy started messaging back and forth. They arranged to reunite the following week, dogs in tow.
   
      “We met up for lunch with our pups, who also hit it off,” recalls Cindy.
   
      Chatting over Lebanese food, the two women picked up where they’d left off at the airport.
   
      Their rapport, says Maggie, felt “super natural.”
   
      As the lunch stretched on, the two only grew more comfortable in one another’s presence. And Deniro and Scarlett O’Hara followed suit.
   
      “When the dogs connected and we realized how close we live to each other in DC, that only strengthened it,” says Maggie.
   
      Maggie and Cindy learned they were alike in small ways – they both love fall, calling the season where the leaves turn auburn their favorite of year – and in bigger ways – they both share the same Catholic faith, for example.
   
      “Maggie’s energy was very similar to my energy,” adds Cindy. “We had a lot of common interests and still have – we both aligned in our political thoughts and we both aligned on the types of movies we liked.
   
      “And of course the puppy life. We never found something not to talk about. She’s very extroverted. I’m extroverted. So it just worked out.”
   
      Maggie and Cindy agreed to meet again. 
   
      Time passed, and these meet-ups became more and more frequent.
   
      Maggie was committed to helping Cindy find a new job. Whenever something came up that could be suitable, she’d forward it Cindy’s way.
   
      Despite her reservations, Maggie went through with her wedding. Later down the line, she and her husband separated. Cindy supported Maggie throughout.
   
      “I think it helped down the road that I was an outlet that didn’t know him, for Maggie to talk about her feelings and her situations after she was married,” says Cindy. “I was there to lend an ear.”
   
      Cindy calls their conversations a “judgment-free zone” and stresses this went both ways.
   
      “We could very much talk to each other honestly.”
   
      About a year after meeting Cindy at the airport, Maggie started working as an inhouse recruiter. A job came up at her company that she thought Cindy would be perfect for, and she suggested her friend apply.
   
      To Cindy and Maggie’s mutual delight, Cindy got the job. The two women became work colleagues, and were able to spend even more time together.
   
      “We would have lunches and celebrate each other’s birthdays and have our coffee – maybe way too many during Pumpkin Spice Latte season,” says Cindy.
   
      “Cindy actually threw me a birthday party one year at the office,” recalls Maggie. “It was pumpkin themed.”
   
      In return, Maggie baked Cindy a birthday carrot cake, knowing it was her friend’s favorite. Maggie navigated the DC Metro on a freezing day in February, cake in hand, to surprise Cindy at the office.
   
      Maggie and Cindy’s lives became more and more intertwined, with Maggie becoming close with many of Cindy’s friends.
   
      “Her energy is infectious,” says Cindy. “Every one of my friends, they all get on with Maggie and they love her.”
   
      After her divorce, Maggie started dating again. When she was vetting prospective partners, she’d take the men on double dates with Cindy and Cindy’s boyfriend.
   
      Deniro and Scarlett O’Hara also continued enjoying each other’s company, and Maggie and Cindy would often dog sit for each other.
   
      When Cindy got engaged in 2015, there was “no question” that Maggie would be among her bridesmaids. By then, the stranger she’d met at the airport was one of her closest friends.
   
      “I wanted the most important and supportive people in my life to be my bridesmaids. The people who made me feel proud about myself,” says Cindy. “Maggie was one of them, since she had not only become such a good friend over the years, but was also the reason for my career and success.”
   
      “I was ecstatic to be Cindy’s bridesmaid,” recalls Maggie. “Her friends adore her and being the newest friend to the group was humbling and beautiful.”  
   
      Today, Maggie and Cindy no longer work together, and Maggie no longer lives in DC.
   
      But while the two women don’t see one another as often as they used to, their friendship remains strong. Whenever Maggie and Cindy reunite, they feel like no time has passed. And when they’re apart, they root for each other from afar. 
   
      “No matter where she is, I love the idea that we’re there – we’re always going be there,” says Maggie. “And I love that, it’s effortless.”
   
      Cindy still lives in DC, now with her husband and her young daughter. Maggie was there at Cindy’s baby shower, to help her welcome her child. Today, Cindy loves her job, and credits her current career success to Maggie.
   
      “Who knows where I would be today – and if I would have had any of the same sense of accomplishment – had we never crossed paths,” she says.
   
      Since Maggie moved away from DC, she’s lived in Chicago, New York and Florida. Most recently, she moved to Los Angeles. She’s currently on a six-month sabbatical traveling with her partner in his camper van, visiting American ski resorts.
   
      “It is interesting, because I thought my life was going to take a completely different trajectory,” says Maggie, reflecting on meeting Cindy on the eve of her marriage.
   
      “I didn’t keep the husband, kept the friend,” she adds, laughing.
   
      “My life has been consistently inconsistent but the things that stay true are my authentic friendships, my ‘framily.’ I never feel lost because I have Cindy in my life.”
   
      Sadly Deniro and Scarlett O’Hara have both passed away, but Maggie and Cindy supported each other through those losses, and enjoy sharing memories of their dogs with each other. And they still credit Deniro for bringing them together in the first place.
   
      Both Maggie and Cindy say their random airport meeting and subsequent enduring friendship taught them the importance of practicing openness, especially when traveling.
   
      “You never know how that is going to change your life, or how that’s going to turn out,” says Cindy. “I still think it’s crazy that one of my closest friends was someone I met at the airport.”
   
      “Be vulnerable,” agrees Maggie. “I was crying. I didn’t even know if I wanted to meet anyone new.”
   
      The two also stress the importance of following up if you meet a potential friend on your travels.
   
      “Taking the initiative after, if you feel that connection,” says Maggie. “It doesn’t matter what age you are – don’t be embarrassed. Email that person back, be excited, say yes.” 
   
      While Maggie and Cindy have shared many special memories over their decade of friendship, they’ve never traveled together, and haven’t sat side by side in an airport since they first met in the Miami International Airport departures hall 12 years ago. They both say they’d love to go on an adventure together one day.
   
      “I know Maggie and I will continue to share memories until we are in our 90s or older,” says Cindy. “Perhaps we will travel the world together after we retire. See what other chance encounters we may come across while waiting in airports.”

      The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday halted the emergency use authorization of Evusheld because it does not appear to protect against Covid-19 from viral variants currently circulating in the United States.
   
      Evusheld is a monoclonal antibody therapy used to prevent Covid-19 in immunocompromised people, who are less likely to generate an immune response from Covid-19 vaccination. 
   
      US officials have warned for months that the antibody therapy was not working against certain emerging variants, but it was still available. CNN had previously reported that many patients who used the medication weren’t aware the medication was no longer as effective as it once was, and continued to rely on it for protection against Covid-19.
   
      On Thursday, the FDA revised Evusheld’s emergency use authorization to limit it to when the combined frequency of non-susceptible coronavirus variants is less than or equal to 90%.
   
      Data has shown Evusheld is unlikely to work against XBB, XBB.1.5, BQ.1 and BQ.1.1; combined, these variants are estimated to be causing nearly 93% of new US Covid-19 cases.  
   
      “This means that Evusheld is not expected to provide protection against developing COVID-19 if exposed to those variants,” the FDA said in a statement Thursday.
   
      The agency said that if someone becomes infected and develops Covid-19 symptoms, they should seek medical care and may be able to use antivirals Paxlovid, remdesivir or molnupiravir, all of which work against currently circulating variants. 
   
      On Friday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released updated information or immunocompromised people, urging them to take additional measures to protect themselves against the coronavirus. 
   
      It says they should get an updated Covid-19 vaccine, spend time outdoors and improve ventilation indoors, wash hands and wear a well-fitting mask in crowded indoor spaces. It urges people to get tested if they’ve been exposed and take steps before they become ill to learn where they can access testing and treatments. 
   
      This week, the CDC launched a website to help people find free Covid-19 testing sites in their area.
 
      Several antibody therapies used against Covid-19 earlier in the pandemic are no longer available because the virus has evolved and they are no longer effective. AstraZeneca, the maker of Evusheld, said in a statement that it is investigating the safety and efficacy of a “next-generation long-acting antibody” to prevent Covid-19 among immune-compromised people.
   
      Although Evusheld isn’t authorized for now, the FDA said providers should hold on to the medicine. 
   
      “The U.S. Government recommends that facilities and providers with Evusheld retain all product in the event that SARS-CoV-2 variants which are neutralized by Evusheld become more prevalent in the U.S. in the future,” the agency said.

But for Donna Kelce, the success of both her sons will provide a conflict of interest.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/30/sport/donna-kelce-jason-travis-super-bowl-lvii-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230130110437-travis-donna-jason-kelce-split-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-01-30T11:34:05Z,"
      Seeing your children succeed is what every parent wants. But for Donna Kelce, the success of both her sons will provide a conflict of interest. 
   
      Donna’s two sons – Jason and Travis – are stars in the NFL, both stalwarts for their respective Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs, and on Sunday, the whole Kelce family had a day to remember as the Eagles and the Chiefs both booked their tickets to Super Bowl LVII in Arizona where they will face off against each other for the Lombardi Trophy. 
   
      When they do, Donna will officially become the first mother to have two sons play against each other in the Super Bowl, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
   
      She commemorated her sons reaching the Super Bowl by tweeting: “#HeightsHighandUCBearcatSuperBowl” – a reference to both sons attending Cleveland Heights High School and the University of Cincinnati. 
   
      Although they won’t actually take the field at the same time as they both play on offense – Jason is an All-Pro center and Travis is an All-Pro tight end – the game will likely prove difficult to watch for Donna as each of her sons will look to claim their second career Super Bowl. 
   
      Both played vital parts in their teams reaching the 2022 season finale: Jason a rock for the Eagles in their dominant victory over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship and Travis finishing with seven catches for 78 yards and a touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship. 
   
      Unfortunately for Donna, unlike she’s done in the past, she wasn’t able to watch both of her sons in action in their conference championship matches due to the timings of Sunday’s games. 
   
      In last year’s postseason, Donna was able to hop quickly from Tampa to Kansas City to watch both the Eagles and the Chiefs play in their Wild Card matchups on the same day. 
   
      According to Donna, she was watching Jason’s game in person in Philadelphia before watching Travis’ game in the Lincoln Financial Field stadium. 
   
      “It’s your hopes and dreams coming true, but it’s your worst fears,” Donna told PJ Ziegler of FOX 8. “Somebody is going to go home a loser, and neither one of them lose very well.”

      Queen of clean Marie Kondo admits that tidying up is no longer top of her to-do list.
   
      Posting on her website shortly after the birth of her third child in 2021, the Japanese organization expert reflected on motherhood, saying she had “eased up on herself” when it comes to tidying.
   
      “Just after my older daughter was born, I felt unable to forgive myself for not being able to manage my life as I had before. But, with time, I eased up on myself; then, after I gave birth to my second daughter, I let go of my need for perfection altogether,” she wrote.
   
      “I am busier than ever after having my third child, so I have grown to accept that I cannot tidy every day – and that is okay!” Kondo added.
   
      Speaking at a recent media webinar and virtual tea ceremony, Kondo said: “My home is messy, but the way I am spending my time is the right way for me at this time at this stage of my life.” 
   
      According to The Washington Post, which reported on the event, the 38-year-old called herself a “professional tidier” who previously strived for a perfectly organized home. Now, she has realized what is important to her, and that is enjoying her time with her children.
   
      “I have kind of given up on that in a good way for me,” she explained.
   
      Nowadays, the star of Netflix show “Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,” is looking at tidiness through a different lens.
   
      In her latest book, “Kurashi at Home: How to Organize Your Space and Achieve Your Ideal Life,” Kondo explores the Japanese concept of kurashi, or “way of life,” expanding on simple ways to “spark joy every day and lead a joyful life.”
   
      “Tidying up means dealing with all the ‘things’ in your life. So, what do you really want to put in order?” she asks in her book.
   
      In other words, tidying in its most conventional sense has taken a back seat, with her teachings now focusing on what matters most in order to live one’s best life. 
   
      The question Kondo leaves readers with is: “What if every decision you made, every goal you set and every aspect of your life was guided by what sparks joy?”

It's the latest in a series of older tracks regaining popularity through TV, as seen when ""Stranger Things"" heavily featured Kate Bush in its fourth season.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/31/entertainment/linda-ronstadt-last-of-us-long-long-time-cec/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230131151137-03-tv-music.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-01-31T18:03:36Z,"
      Linda Ronstadt’s “Long, Long Time” appeared not once but three times in Sunday’s episode of “The Last of Us.” And fans of HBO’s newest hit were clearly moved by Ronstadt’s song, as streams of her ballad have ballooned since the episode premiered. 
   
      Between 11 p.m. ET and midnight on Sunday, Spotify streams of “Long, Long Time” increased 4,900% compared to the week prior, the platform reported this week. CNN has reached out to Spotify to confirm the number of streams before and after “The Last of Us” aired. In the meantime, the song is already appearing in TikToks from weepy viewers who loved the episode.
   
      The song was performed by actors Murray Bartlett and Nick Offerman in a pivotal sequence in the third episode of “The Last of Us” in which their characters meet by chance, take turns playing Ronstadt’s song at very different tempos on an antique piano and share a kiss (and, eventually, almost 20 years of their lives). The episode closes with Ronstadt’s rendition of the song played on a cassette tape. 
   
      “I knew that song needed to hit certain things about longing and aching and endlessly unrequited love,” series co-creator Craig Mazin told Variety. 
   
      Ronstadt released “Long, Long Time” in 1970 as a single from her second album, “Silk Purse.” It charted for 12 weeks, peaking at number 25, per Billboard. It was her first single to appear on a Billboard chart.
   
      The renewed interest in Ronstadt’s ballad is drawing comparisons to the overwhelming wave of popularity “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)” received when the Kate Bush power ballad was featured in several episodes of “Stranger Things” last year. Almost 40 years after it was first released, Bush’s signature song returned to charts, reaching No. 1i n the UK and No. 4 in the US. In 1985, the song peaked at No. 30, Billboard reported. Around the time the fourth season of “Stranger Things” was released in late May, “Running Up That Hill” began to net millions of streams a day. 
   
      Über-popular series, particularly those with large Gen Z viewership, have shown a unique power to resurrect certain songs, particularly on TikTok. “Euphoria” introduced younger viewers to the ’70s jam “Right Down the Line” by Gerry Rafferty, a song Zendaya’s character Rue grooves to more than once in the series’ second season. And it resonated, too, with millions of people on TikTok: The hashtag #rightdowntheline has been seen more than 5 million times on the app, and more than 34,000 videos use the official version of the song as an audio snippet. (HBO, home to “The Last of Us” and “Euphoria,” shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.)
   
      Netflix’s mega-hit “Wednesday,” which broke viewership records previously held by “Stranger Things,” included a viral scene set to The Cramps’ “Goo Goo Muck” in which the titular Addams Family daughter performed an idiosyncratic dance to the punk anthem. Netflix’s clip of the scene has racked up more than 43 million views and Google searches for the song spiked in early December, shortly after the show’s streaming release. But the scene also resurrected, if indirectly, Lady Gaga’s “Bloody Mary,” off her 2011 album “Born This Way.” Millions of TikTok users eager to recreate the “Wednesday” dance soundtracked their attempts to Gaga’s vampy deep cut, which rocketed the song onto Billboard charts for the first time (though it was Gaga’s 36th entry on the Billboard Hot 100).
   
      Meanwhile, Ronstadt’s ballad isn’t even the first song featured in “The Last of Us” to pique fans’ interest. The pilot episode ended with Depeche Mode’s “Never Let Me Down Again,” whose streams tripled overnight from 26,000 on the day the pilot aired to 83,000 the following day, according to Billboard. Depeche Mode’s official YouTube account even added a parenthetical to the title for the song’s music video: “(Heard on Episode 1 of The Last of Us).”
   
      So far, few of the recent old-songs-turned-new-hits have reached the same heights as Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” did last year, but “The Last of Us” shows that its success was not anomalous.

      Cindy Williams, the dynamic actress known best for playing the bubbly Shirley Feeney on the beloved sitcom “Laverne & Shirley,” has died, according to a statement from her family, provided to CNN by a representative. She was 75.

She was one of a kind, beautiful, generous and possessed a brilliant sense of humor and a glittering spirit that everyone loved.”

      On the series, she starred opposite the late Penny Marshall as one half of a dynamic friend duo whose adventures powered the show, which ran for eight seasons from 1976-1983. 
   
      Born in Van Nuys, California, Williams’ interest in acting throughout high school led her to studying theater at Los Angeles City College, according to a biography provided by her family. Some of Williams’ first professional acting credits include a three-episode arc on the 1969 series “Room 222” and appearances on other shows, like “Nanny and the Professor” and “Love, American Style,” in the early 1970’s.
   
      Williams went on to become a prolific working television and film actor, appearing in dozens of titles. But it was after she first appeared as Shirley Feeney on “Happy Days” in 1975 that her career began to take shape.
   
      The lighthearted “Laverne & Shirley” proved to be a ratings hit and earned six Golden Globe nominations, including two for best comedy series and one for Williams in the best actress in a comedy category. 
   
      Williams also appeared in several standout films. Most notably, she starred in George Lucas’ 1973 film “American Graffiti,” which earned Williams a British Academy Film Awards nomination for best supporting actress. The film,  about a group of friends who spend one wild night together before leaving for college, went on to be nominated for five Oscars, including best picture, at the 1974 Academy Awards. Williams also had roles in acclaimed films “Travels with My Aunt” by George Cukor’ in 1972 and “The Conversation” from director Francis Ford Coppola in 1974.
   
      Williams was also an accomplished stage actress, with a long list of credits. Last year, she took her one-woman show, “Me, Myself and Shirley,” where she shared stories from throughout her career, on a national tour. She had at least one series of dates scheduled for later this year.
   
      Upon news of her passing, Williams’ friends and fans took to social media to honor the late actress, who left a legacy of laughter. 
   
      “Happy Days” star and film director Ron Howard tweeted that Williams’ “unpretentious intelligence, talent, wit & humanity impacted every character she created & person she worked with,” going on to say that the pair worked together on six different projects together. “Lucky me,” he added.
   
      Henry Winkler, who played Fonzie on “Happy Days,” called Williams “a fine and talented human being” on Twitter.
   
      “Oh how I loved Cindy Williams,” Yvette Nicole Brown, who worked with Williams in 2016 when she guest starred in an episode of CBS’s “The Odd Couple,” shared on Twitter. “She was as lovely as I always imagined she’d be.” 
   
      Actor Jason Alexander wrote on Twitter: “I did not know Cindy Williams but boy did I adore her work, especially the wacky joyful funny pleasure of watching her Laverne and Shirley days. I pray she had a good life and send my sympathy to those who knew and loved her.” 
   
      Williams’ children added in their statement that they were proud of their mother for many reasons – “her lifelong mission to rescue animals, her prolific artistry, her faith” among them – but “most of all, her ability to make the world laugh!” 
   
      “May that laughter continue in everyone, because she would want that,” the statement said. “Thank you for loving our Mom, she loved you too.”

      Rupert Grint found fame as a teen playing Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter franchise, but it wasn’t always easy.
   
      “‘Potter’ was so full on — [filming] all year, then we’d promote the rest of the time,” the now 34-year-old actor said in a recently published interview with Bustle. “It was quite suffocating.”
   
      These days Grint is enjoying a bit of an acclaimed second act with roles in M. Night Shyamalan’s Apple+ series “Servant” and another Shyamalan project, the feature film “Knock at the Cabin.”
   
      Grint told Bustle that initially he wasn’t sure if he wanted to continue acting after “Potter.” 
   
      “I wanted a break, to reflect on everything… It was an out-of-body experience for a while, but I think we finished at the right time,” he said. “If we continued, it could’ve gone downhill.”
   
      He was 11 and acting in British theater when he got the role of Ron and 22 by the time the franchise ended.
   
      Grint had so many similarities with the character of Ron, including same first initial and both being redheads, that he found it difficult to maintain separation.
   
      “I was feeling the difficulty of being seen, being overshadowed,” he said.
   
      “In the movies, we merged into one,” Grint told the publication. “By the end of it, I was playing myself. The lines were blurred.”
   
      Still, he is grateful for the role and described being part of the “Potter” experience with fellow Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson “a really unique experience only us core group really know.”
   
      “I answer to it, if someone calls me Ron,” Grint said. “It’s my second name.”

      The Washington Post on Tuesday became the latest media company to conduct layoffs, cutting 20 roles in a move that publisher Fred Ryan had indicated last month the newspaper would take in early 2023.
   
      Sally Buzbee, executive editor of The Post, described the decision to cut the jobs as “difficult” in a memo to employees and disclosed that the newspaper had identified 30 open roles that it will no longer fill.
   
      “While such changes are not easy, evolution is necessary for us to stay competitive, and the economic climate has guided our decision to act now,” Buzbee said. “We believe these steps will ultimately help us to fulfill our mission to scrutinize power and empower readers.”
   
      The layoffs hit multiple departments at The Post, and included pulling the plug on Launcher, the newspaper’s gaming vertical that launched in 2019, a spokesperson for The Post said.
   
      Spokespeople for The Post have stressed that the newspaper will not reduce headcount in 2023 as it will reallocate resources and invest in other areas. 
   
      The Washington Post Guild, however, denounced the move to lay off staffers.
   
      “But to be clear, we believe any job eliminations right now — at a time of continued growth and expansion — are unacceptable,” the Guild said Tuesday in a note obtained by CNN. “To our colleagues impacted today, we are sorry, and we’re here for you.”
   
      “Today is a hard day for us all,” the Guild added. “We’re devastated for our colleagues and angered by the irresponsible and illogical decision making from The Post. But we’re not done fighting or standing up for each other.”
   
      Buzbee said in her memo that employees impacted by the layoffs are being offered severance and are eligible to apply for other open roles. 
   
      The layoffs come days after The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, visited the newsroom and held meetings with Ryan and Buzbee.
   
      Ryan’s December announcement about future layoffs prompted fury inside the Post newsroom, nearly a dozen employees at The Post told CNN at the time. “The mood is really grim,” one staffer had told CNN. “People are just so livid right now. It’s bad. Just bad.”
   
      In recent months, the media and technology sectors have taken a battering as advertisers tighten spending amid economic uncertainty.
   
      Across the news industry, layoffs have been rampant. CNN, NBC News, MSNBC, Vox Media, Gannett and other news organizations have cut their workforces in recent months. And companies that haven’t laid off staffers have taken strong measures to reduce spending.
   
      Spotify announced it was laying off hundreds of staffers on Monday. Google last week joined Big Tech giants Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft in announcing layoffs. Google said it had made the decision to eliminate 6% of its workforce, which translates to approximately 12,000 jobs.
   
      Entertainment giants, such as Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN’s parent company) and Paramount Global, have also trimmed their workforces.

      Say goodbye to the Tiger; it’s time to hop into the Year of the Rabbit. 
   
      For many people, Lunar New Year, which falls on January 22 this year, is a time to consult the stars to find out what lies ahead in the coming months.   
   
      Most people know the basics: The 12-year Chinese zodiac calendar cycle is represented by 12 different animals – the Chinese zodiac signs. Your zodiac animal is determined by your year of birth. 
   
      But that’s only the start. For faithful followers of the system, a year isn’t just categorized by its animal. There’s also a complex sexagenary cycle made up of 10 heavenly stems and 12 earthly branches. 
   
      Every year, a heavenly stem (one of five elements, which fall into the yin or yang category) is paired with an earthly branch (one of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals).
   
      Gui Mao is the 40th element of the Chinese sexagenary cycle – the Heavenly Stem “Gui” represents water, whereas the earthly branch “Mao” represents Rabbit. That makes 2023 the Year of the Water Rabbit.
   
      “Gui Mao Rabbit Year is quite a special year – when all the elements in a year are yin,” says Thierry Chow, a Hong Kong-based geomancy consultant known for blending traditional Chinese geomancy with modern design elements. 
   
      “It’s also uncommon to have the combination of water and rabbit. The rabbit represents wood. Water nurtures wood (according to Chinese geomancy).”
   
      She says industries with wood as their main element – like culture, publishing, agriculture and furniture – would benefit. Fire industries, on the other hand, including digital and technology businesses, may suffer as fire is afraid of Water.
   
      “The Year of Water Rabbit is going to be a gentler year. We’ll have time to take a breather. We’ve been in the tunnel for the last few years, and the light is getting bigger now,” says Chow.
   
      Followers believe that for each Chinese zodiac sign, luck will depend largely on the positions of the Tai Sui –  the stellar deities thought to rotate parallel to and in the opposite direction of Jupiter.
   
      To calculate how each person will be affected in a particular year, a Chinese geomancy consultant will look at one’s birth chart, which is composed of a wide range of elements – such as the day and time of their birth – to see how they may interact with the year’s elements.
   
      These combinations play an important role for those who follow them, helping them make huge life decisions for the year ahead, such as whether they should get married or start a business.
   
      Different geomancy masters may interpret the data differently. Still, there is a general consensus on what the year means for each zodiac animal based on the positions of the stars, especially Tai Sui.
   
      If your zodiac sign clashes with Tai Sui – aka the Grand Duke of Jupiter – in a particular year, the experts say you might find yourself dealing with disruptions. 
   
      For those who may be in conflict with Tai Sui this year, Chow says they should remember the calendar is a rotating cycle.
   
      “It’s like playing musical chairs – whoever sits in the spot gets Tai Sui. You’ll change your position next round,” says Chow, whose zodiac sign will also be in an unfavorable position with Tai Sui this year.
   
      To resolve clashes, one could go to a Chinese temple and make offerings to representations of Tai Sui.  
   
      “Even if you don’t believe in it 100%, I feel like it gives you a nice kickstart to the year psychologically,” says Chow. “When things happen along the way, you’ll remember you did that, and it will give you a little cushion.”
   
      Now, it’s time to get specific. 
   
      To determine what the Year of the Rabbit could mean for you, find your year of birth and the corresponding animal in the above gallery before reading Chow’s predictions below. 
   
      People born in the Year of the Rabbit will be facing their “Ben Ming Nian” – their own zodiac year – in 2023. Followers believe there will be more disruptions and instabilities in the year to come as a result.
   
      “People born in the Rabbit year have to expect big changes health-wise, career-wise and relationship-wise. It could be a bit nerve-wracking, especially for those whose birth charts don’t favor Water,” says Chow.
   
      “But do remember it never is all bad. It may mean an opportunity to grow.”
   
      Rabbits should try to attract positive energy and join happy events when possible.
   
      They should also travel to destinations to their south – doesn’t matter if these southern destinations are within their city or outside their country – says Chow.
   
      It’s set to be a pretty good year for Dragons out there. No unlucky stars are affecting their year. 
   
      “There are no outstanding concerns, except maybe health for those born in the summer and autumn. They could easily feel stressed,” says Chow.
   
      But the geomancy expert urges Dragons not to make rash decisions at work. 
   
      “It doesn’t mean overthinking. Just let things sit longer before you make a decision,” says Chow.
   
      Single Dragons could meet potential romantic partners this year. Their lucky colors are metallic, such as gold or silver. 
   
      As for traveling, head west for better fortunes, says Chow.
   
      People born in Snake years will enjoy good news and abundance as the travel star, Yi Ma Xing, and the fortune star, Cai Xing, will reign over them this year.
   
      “Opportunities, new directions and advancements will come to you at work,” says Chow. “But Snakes need to find balance in life and take a break when needed.”
   
      Romantically, Snakes may find love while out traveling this year. Chow advises them to wear blue or gold and travel to the west or north.
   
      “This year, Horses will have the Peach Blossom Star (Taohua Xing) shining over them. That’s always good news,” says Chow.
   
      Professionally, they’ll find new opportunities and meet a lot of guardians who will assist them.
   
      They’ll enjoy good relationships. She says this might be the right year for those wanting to get engaged or married.
   
      But Chow issues one reminder for Horses: Pay attention to their family’s physical and mental health.
   
      “They can wear colorful clothes like pink, orange and a bit of yellow. In terms of traveling, they can head to their south,” says Chow.
   
      This year, Goats will greet Tai Sui. 
   
      It’s generally a positive influence on their luck, but at the same time, it could also mean that the year will be exhausting too. That’s why Goats need to care for themselves and rest when needed. 
   
      “Save some time to get to know yourself better. Career-wise, you need to stay humble and keep a low profile. Observe more. Opportunities will present themselves at the right moment,” says Chow.
   
      On the relationship front, people born in Goat years will enjoy a smooth year.
   
      “They’re more likely to meet new people, new friends, and even new loves this year,” says Chow, adding that a bit of gold and a visit to the west could add to their luck.
   
      Good news for Monkeys: they will be in harmonious union with Tai Sui this year.
   
      Chow says they will be showered with admiration from those around them at work.
   
      But that doesn’t mean they should live recklessly. Instead, the geomancer says, “they should play safe this year, especially those who love extreme sports.” 
   
      In terms of relationships, they are prone to arguments and drama, which could be avoided by improving communication this year.
   
      Yellow and beige are the color palette for Monkeys in 2023, and they could look towards the west for travel inspiration, says Chow.
   
      Roosters need to brace themselves – they will be clashing with Tai Sui this year, meaning the coming months could be unstable and present plenty of changes.
   
      Advice from Chow: Embrace the chaos and travel more.
   
      “Muster as much positive energy as you could and be more aware that you may be easier to attract conflicts this year,” she says. “But understand that these changes are for the better.”
   
      To alleviate the blow, they could wear more yellow and brown and visit places in the west or north.
   
      Being in union with Tai Sui, people born under the sign of the Dog will likely enjoy a pleasant year with significant advancements in career and finance. 
   
      But Dogs must remind themselves to be humble and listen to others, especially friends and people they trust, says Chow. They’ll tell you important things that will greatly benefit you this year.
   
      “Their lucky colors are silver and blue, and their lucky place is to their north,” says Chow.
   
      Pigs will be greeting Tai Sui, meaning it should generally be a positive year.
   
      But, on the flip side, greeting Tai Sui could also affect one’s health because of the extra workload. 
   
      “You have to balance your work and play time equally,” Chow says.
   
      People born during Pig years may enjoy professional success if they are willing to focus on teamwork. 
   
      “Relationship-wise, it’ll be a very good year for you. You will meet new friends and potential new love,” says Chow.
   
      To enhance fortune, Pigs could wear pink and purple more often and plan a trip to the south, she adds.
   
      People born in the years of the Rat will be in conflicts with Tai Sui, also known as Xing (torturing) Tai Sui, next year. 
   
      “Generally, it means a tougher year,” says Chow. “But when there is yin, there is always yang, too. So remember, it never really is all bad.” 
   
      Rats should be more cautious about health and work. They could be prone to minor injuries and miscommunication this year. 
   
      Chow urges them to wear cheerful colors – like pink and orange – and visit warmer places.
   
      Oxen will enjoy an exciting year with the travel star and fortune star shining over them.
   
      “They will find new opportunities and their finances will reach a new level. They’ll probably travel more for work and personal reasons. But since they’re traveling and working more, they need to be aware of their health,” says Chow. 
   
      Those who are single and looking for love may have some good luck this year. 
   
      Meanwhile, when choosing a travel destination, they could journey to the north, says Chow.
   
      For those born in Tiger years, their “Ben Ming Nian” is over. 
   
      “That means, whatever tough times and instabilities they’re experiencing, it’s going to get better soon,” says Chow. “But patience is key because changes won’t be immediate.”
   
      Tigers, especially those born in spring and summer, should take time to recover in the first half of the year and only make big decisions in the second half of the year, she says. 
   
      They should take things slowly in relationships and “save themselves some me-time.”
   
      Wearing yellow, blue and brown could cheer them up. They could also travel to their north and west, concludes Chow.

      Videos purportedly capturing the moments before the shooting death of a double-amputee man holding a knife after a stabbing attack are raising questions about whether police used excessive force in the Southern California city of Huntington Park. 
   
      On Thursday afternoon, Huntington Park Police Department officers responded to a report of a stabbing, the department said in a statement Monday. Responding officers found a victim suffering from “a life-threatening stab wound resulting in a collapsed lung and internal bleeding,” the statement said.
   
      The victim described the attacker as a Black man in a wheelchair who “dismounted the wheelchair, ran to the victim without provocation, and stabbed him in the side of the chest with a 12” butcher knife” and then fled the scene in his wheelchair, HPPD said.
   
      The victim was taken to a local hospital and was in critical condition, according to HPPD.    
   
      During their search, police found the alleged suspect a few blocks away holding a 12-inch butcher knife, HPPD said. The suspect allegedly ignored officer commands and threatened to “advance or throw the knife,” and officers used two separate Tasers to try and subdue the suspect but failed, HPPD said. 
   
      “The suspect continued to threaten officers with the butcher knife, resulting in an officer-involved shooting,” HPPD said. It was not immediately clear how many officers were present or shot the suspect. 
   
      The suspect was struck by gunfire in the upper torso and was pronounced dead on scene, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said in an initial statement.    
   
      The involved officers were placed on paid administrative leave pending ongoing investigations from HPPD, the sheriff’s department’s Homicide Bureau and the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, HPPD said.
   
      The sheriff’s department confirmed it is investigating but declined to comment. 
   
      While authorities did not name the man who died, family members identified him as 36-year-old Anthony Lowe.    
   
      Attorneys for Lowe’s family have filed a claim against the city – the first step toward a possible wrongful death lawsuit. Huntington Park officials have 45 days to respond, after which a lawsuit can be filed in state court.
   
      The city confirmed receipt of the claim but had no comment, according to spokesman Sergio Infanzon.
   
      Lowe’s family is demanding the police officers involved are identified and prosecuted. They’re also demanding that surveillance video from a nearby medical clinic, which apparently shows the entire incident, be turned over for the family to review. 
   
      CNN reached out to the medical clinic, which declined to share the video and said it had been turned over to authorities. 
   
      Bystander videos of the incident posted on social media appear to show the confrontation between police and Lowe on Thursday just before the shooting. A family member of Lowe confirmed to CNN the man in the video is Lowe.
   
      In one video, two uniformed officers are seen pointing their guns at Lowe. Lowe then appears to move himself in the opposite direction, holding something shiny in his hands, while an officer walks behind him. A police car then obscures the view.  Another video from a different view shows the moment when officers appear to open fire.
   
      “The way they killed my son, they murdered my son in a wheelchair with no legs,” Dorothy Lowe, Anthony Lowe’s mother, said at a news conference Monday. “So they do need to do something about it, because I do I want justice for my son.”    
   
      Family members did not address the suggestion that Lowe may have stabbed someone prior to the shooting.
   
      The family and community members are calling on Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón to charge the involved officers. 
   
      “There can be no justification for killing Anthony, and we’re here to stand with his family and his community to fight for justice for Anthony,” said Cliff Smith, an organizer with the Coalition for Community Control Over the Police.
   
      The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office will conduct an independent review after the sheriff’s department completes its investigation, but Communications Director Tiffiny Blacknell told CNN in a statement that it is inappropriate to comment until the case is formally presented.
   
      “We know that the Black community in Los Angeles is reeling and searching for answers. We know nothing can heal the trauma the community is experiencing right now,” she said, adding that “Los Angeles County deserves to know how and why these incidents have occurred.”
   
      The California Attorney General’s office, which is required under state law to independently review officer-involved shootings in the state, told CNN that it is not investigating the matter “at this point in time.”
   
      Lowe was a loving, caring father who loved to dance and was quite funny, Ebonique Simon, mother to one of Lowe’s children, told CNN. He had been “dealing with a lot of depression” over the loss of his legs in an incident around a year ago, she said.
   
      The family is heartbroken over the loss and cannot make sense of the story the police are telling, she told CNN. 
   
      The family is eagerly awaiting autopsy results as the coroner’s investigator assured them that “Anthony’s body will tell the story,” she said.

      A former senior Russian army officer says he saw his comrades torturing prisoners of war in Ukraine, in a rare eyewitness account from within Moscow’s ranks to address widespread allegations of Russian war crimes.
   
      Speaking to CNN’s Erin Burnett on Thursday, former Lt. Konstantin Yefremov said he witnessed a deputy commander torturing prisoners of war and threatening them with sexual violence, adding that no one dared to speak out against the officer for fear he would attack them too.
   
      “He could have easily shot me or anyone else who said that they didn’t agree with this,” Yefremov said, adding that he personally witnessed the interrogations of three Ukrainian prisoners of war.
   
      “Besides, he was drunk nonstop, and he was driving around the nearby villages where there were other prisoners of war. As far as I know, there were about 20 others, Ukrainian prisoners of war,” he said.
   
      Yefremov is the most senior Russian officer to speak openly about what he saw in Ukraine. 
   
      He is now hoping the United States will grant him asylum after he fled Russia last month following his dismissal from the military for refusing to return to Ukraine.
   
      “I ask the Ukrainian people for forgiveness that I came to their land with a gun in my hand,” he said. 
   
      Yefremov’s account follows the admission earlier this week by a former Wagner mercenary that the brutality he witnessed in Ukraine ultimately pushed him to defect.
   
      In an exclusive CNN interview, Andrei Medvedev, who is seeking asylum after crossing from Russia into Norway, alleged that reluctant recruits and prisoners were shot in front of Wagner newcomers.
   
      The allegations of the former Russian fighters also come amid growing calls from Ukraine and the international community to hold Moscow accountable for alleged war crimes committed during its nearly year-long invasion of its neighbor.
   
      On Thursday, European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen announced that an international center for the prosecution of the “crime of aggression” in Ukraine would be set up in The Hague.
   
      Russia has repeatedly denied accusations its forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.
   
      In November, Russian officials said a target of 300,000 recruits had been met under a mobilization drive announced by President Vladimir Putin in late September following a series of major setbacks for Moscow in the war.
   
      Yefremov outlined what he described as “dire” circumstances for those drafted into the Russian army to fight in Ukraine, saying many were unprepared for what awaits them on the battlefield.
   
      “They have not been trained and they are not even aware of what kind of horror is awaiting them there,” said Yefremov, describing the soldiers as handymen, not servicemen. 
   
      Yefremov said that “nearly everyone” in the Russian forces knows the mission is wrong.
   
      “They truly do not believe Putin’s fables about Ukraine’s threat of invasion,” he said.
   
      Instead, they are in Ukraine because they have no choice, he said. “It’s either their family and children end up on the streets or they have to be in the trenches,” he said.
   
      And because the troops were drafted, many cannot resign or they will face imprisonment, he said. “So, basically, there is no choice. They either have to remain there or find ways to flee. So, like I have already said, the circumstances are dire,” he said.

      President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met this week for the first time since McCarthy’s election as speaker amid much fanfare, but low expectations.
   
      With a looming debt crisis facing the country, the public messaging on both sides was clear: There’s not a whole lot we agree on now, so let’s keep the conversation going. Biden budget chief Shalanda Young described the negotiations as a “marathon” where the two sides would eventually “find a path.”
   
      Of course, we’ve seen this movie before: In 2011, when the country faced default and the global economy was on edge, then-President Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress reached an agreement in the last few hours before catastrophe was set to strike. Over a decade later, with a more polarized country and even less bipartisanship to speak of, observers shouldn’t expect the current crisis to be resolved until the weather becomes unbearably warm in Washington.
   
      One of the dealmakers who facilitated the 2011 deal was none other than Joe Biden. Now, many in Washington are trying to predict what might unfold over the next several months as the once-and-future dealmaker approaches yet another debt ceiling crisis – but this time as commander in chief. 
   
      The current crisis presents an opportunity for moderates in both parties to unite around the need both to raise the debt ceiling but also to put in place lasting changes that will fundamentally improve America’s fiscal trajectory.
   
      While we wait for an outcome, here are a few themes and trends to watch out for.
   
      A final agreement between the White House and congressional Republicans is likely to hinge on whether a process can be put in place to address federal spending. It’s unlikely negotiators will reach a debt deal that includes specific spending reductions or even general targets, so watch for them to instead establish a process through which those details can be hammered out.
   
      It will be far easier for negotiators to agree on broad terms (such as the idea that deficits and the debt deserve some attention) rather than specific changes to programs or even overarching areas of spending cuts like on defense or domestic discretionary programs.
   
      The 2011 debt ceiling crisis was ultimately averted through the creation of a congressional “supercommittee” (officially called the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction) that was tasked with developing a specific plan to reduce deficits.
   
      Unfortunately, that committee could not reach bipartisan agreement on a final proposal, resulting in the imposition of spending caps that reduced both defense and non-defense discretionary spending on a broad range of items in education, health and human services and even public safety.
   
      What sort of process might be put in place as part of a debt ceiling deal in 2023? Consider existing bipartisan legislation sponsored by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who have long preached the need for consensus on and attention to fiscal issues. Their bill, called the TRUST Act, would create bipartisan and bicameral “rescue committees” that would shore up and reform entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security before their trust funds run out of reserves.
   
      The committees themselves wouldn’t have the ability to make policy changes directly but could make recommendations (requiring bipartisan support within the committee to be considered by either the full House or Senate) that would receive expedited legislative consideration. This is precisely the sort of process-oriented fiscal reform that could make its way into a final agreement between the two sides.
   
      Inclusion of the TRUST Act in a final deal would satisfy GOP concerns about addressing spending, preserve promises made by both sides not to “cut” either Medicare or Social Security as part of the process but also give the Biden White House something it can exchange for GOP votes to avert default.
   
      While right and left have become more polarized, moderates in both chambers will likely have something to say about where the debt ceiling negotiations go. The Problem Solvers Caucus in the House, chaired by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican, and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, have emerged as important voices on substantive, but thorny issues, and were important to passage of Biden’s infrastructure package in 2021.
   
      Similarly, moderate voices in the Senate like Manchin, Romney, Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona independent, and Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, have emerged as important counterweights to those seeking to pull lawmaking toward the poles.  
   
      In the debt ceiling debate, these moderates could play a role not only in brokering a deal, but also ensuring that there are sufficient votes for ultimately raising the debt ceiling. This is particularly the case if McCarthy ends up agreeing to provisions that some conservative Republicans may oppose. McCarthy may have no choice but to rely on a few Democrats, in addition to a majority of Republicans, to get a deal across the finish line.
   
      There will be a lot of back-and-forth, prognostication and apocalyptic talk over the next several months about whether and how the debt ceiling will be raised. Ignore almost all of it. While both sides will invariably conduct some of their negotiations via the media, the real work of cutting a deal will happen behind closed doors and with almost no public visibility.
   
      Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that the “extraordinary measures” being used to stave off default will take us until sometime in early June. Past experience suggests there may be a little wiggle room beyond that. But don’t expect the talks to really heat up for several more months and, even then, the real incentive to complete the negotiations won’t come until the global economy is literally backed into a corner.
   
      That means several more months of wondering, waiting and worrying about whether our broken political system can solve yet another fiscal crisis – one more time.

      America’s major automakers are getting back into Formula 1 racing. Following General Motors’ recent announcement that it’s applying, along with Andretti Global, to field a team in the prestigious racing series, Ford has now announced that it’s getting back into the sport to help build engines.
   
      While GM’s plan requires approval by the sport’s governing body, something that is not guaranteed, Ford has an agreement to work with Red Bull Powertrains which supplies hybrid engines to both of Red Bull’s F1 teams.
   
      “F1 will be an incredibly cost-effective platform to innovate, share ideas and technologies, and engage with tens of millions of new customers,” Ford chief executive Jim Farley said in a statement.
   
      Formula 1 race cars use V6 engines with hybrid electric technology. The cars can produce over 1,000 horsepower and reach speeds of more than 200 miles per hour on track. Ford
            
                (F) and Red Bull will work to create new hybrid power units, which include an internal combustion engine and electric motor, to comply with new requirements for the 2026 racing season. The new power units will rely much more on electric power and will burn renewable fuels in less powerful V6 engines.
   
      If it enters Formula 1, GM
            
                (GM) has said its team will work with Alpine on the power unit for its cars. Alpine is a sports car brand owned by France’s Renault.
   
      Formula 1 racing is very popular in Europe and has recently found increasing popularity in the United States. The Netflix documentary series “Drive to Survive” has been one factor that has increased the sport’s visibility in the US, and races in Miami and Las Vegas have been added to the race calendar in recent years. Before 2022, the only Formula One races in the US in the past decade were held in Austin, Texas, which is still the most popular event on the F1 calendar.
   
      Besides the ability to research electric drive systems, the growing American audience is a key reason Ford decided to get back into the sport, Farley said in an interview with CNN. With the Ford F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E, Ford currently ranks a distant second to Tesla
            
                (TSLA) in electric vehicle sales, and Farley said F1 could help close that gap.
   
      “Both the tech transfer and the marketing,” he said. “It’s a great time to turn a whole new generation of Americans on to these Ford EVs.”
   
      Despite leaving the sport in 2004 after selling Jaguar Racing to Red Bull — Ford owned the Jaguar brand at the time — Ford remains the third most successful engine manufacturer in Formula 1 after Mercedes and Ferrari. Ford first entered the sport in 1968 with Lotus. Ford currently competes in a variety of motorsports, including endurance sports car racing, drag racing and off-road races. Ford and Red Bull already work together in rally racing.

      Madison Russo allegedly used social media to spread awareness about her battle with cancer and to raise almost $40,000 on GoFundMe – but the entire operation was a scam, according to Iowa police, who have charged Russo with theft.
   
      Russo, a 19-year-old TikTok content creator, raised more than $37,303 from 439 donors by falsely claiming she suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Stage 2 pancreatic cancer, and a tumor the “size of a football, that wrapped around her spine,” according to a news release from the Eldridge Police Department.
   
      Police said anonymous witnesses with “medical experience” pointed out “medical discrepancies” in Russo’s social media presence to the investigating officer. A subpoena for medical records found Russo had “never been diagnosed with any kind of cancer or tumor from any medical facilities within the Quad Cities or surrounding cities,” according to the release.
   
      Russo, a resident of Bettendorf, Iowa, was arrested for theft by means of deception on January 23, says the release. 
   
      Police said they are still working to identify alleged victims of Russo’s theft. In addition to soliciting donations on GoFundMe, Russo also “accepted private donations from other businesses, non-profit organizations, school districts and private citizens,” according to police. 
   
      GoFundMe told CNN they had removed the fundraiser, banned Russo from using the platform, and refunded all donors.
   
      “GoFundMe has a zero tolerance policy for misuse of our platform and cooperates with law enforcement investigations of those accused of wrongdoing,” said the organization in an emailed statement. “All donors have been refunded and we have removed this fundraiser. The beneficiary has also been banned from using the platform for any future fundraisers. GoFundMe’s Giving Guarantee offers a full refund in the rare case when something isn’t right; this is the first and only donor protection guarantee in the crowdfunding industry.”
   
      Russo was outspoken about her alleged struggle with cancer, conducting interviews with local press and sharing her story on social media. In October 2022, she spoke with the Eldridge-based North Scott Press for a profile focused on her experience with cancer. She also discussed her cancer journey as a guest speaker at St Ambrose University and at the National Pancreatic Foundation in Chicago, according to the police news release.
   
      Andrea Jaeger, Russo’s attorney, told CNN she had no comment at this time.

      The deep-pocketed network associated with billionaire Charles Koch is preparing to throw its money and weight behind a single Republican candidate in the 2024 presidential primary – in a move that could significantly reshape the GOP field. 
   
      Americans for Prosperity Action, the main political arm of the Koch network, “is prepared to support a candidate in the Republican presidential primary who can lead our country forward, and who can win,” Emily Seidel, the CEO of Americans for Prosperity and a top adviser at AFP Action, wrote in a memo released Sunday.
   
      The memo does not mention Donald Trump, but an official with AFP Action confirmed to CNN that the network is not planning to support the former president’s White House bid.
   
      “To write a new chapter for our county, we need to turn the page on the past,” Seidel wrote to AFP’s staff and activists. “So the best thing for the country would be to have a president in 2025 who represents a new chapter.”
   
      The Koch decision to engage in the GOP primary – after sitting on the sidelines for the two most recent White House nomination fights – is likely to set off a scramble among Republican presidential contenders to win over the Kansas-based industrialist and the hundreds of wealthy donors who help finance his influential, free-market network.
   
      During his White House tenure, Trump, often sparred with Koch officials, who sharply criticized his administration’s trade and hard-line immigration policies. 
   
      AFP Action has not announced a budget for its 2024 political activity, but the network has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in previous election cycles, rivaling the financial reach of the Republican National Committee. Americans for Prosperity has permanent staff in 36 states and touts millions of grassroots activists across the country.
   
      Its political wing also plans to engage earlier and more aggressively in congressional and state-level primaries, both to influence more contests and to find new voters to participate in primaries, AFP Action officials said.
   
      Seidel said the network is stepping up its activity to help address “the broken politics” that she said has created a “toxic situation” in the nation’s capital and blocked policy progress.
   
      “The Republican Party is nominating bad candidates who are advocating for things that go against core American principles,” Seidel wrote. “And the American people are rejecting them.”
   
      And she cast Democrats as pushing “more and more extreme policies.”
   
      Several Republicans weighing 2024 bids have longstanding ties to Koch world, including former Vice President Mike Pence. Marc Short, Pence’s former chief of staff and longtime aide, once oversaw political operations at the Koch network. 
   
      Another potential contender, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, had the financial backing of Koch political committees when he represented Wichita – where Koch Industries is headquartered – as a congressman. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is expected to announce her bid for the Republican nomination later this month, has attended at least one Koch donor conclave. And a Koch-backed super PAC supported Ron DeSantis before he won a competitive GOP primary in 2018 on his way to becoming governor.
   
      The libertarian-leaning network has engaged in a public reset of its priorities in recent years and worked to distance itself from the Republican brand during the Trump era. 
   
      But the network did back some Trump-led efforts, spending heavily, for instance, to promote his $1.5 trillion tax code overhaul in 2017 – despite clashing with the then-president and the RNC on other political and policy matters. 
   
      In one sign of the network’s reach, Seidel noted that AFP and AFP Action participated in more than 450 races in last year’s midterms, knocked on more than 7 million doors and sent out more than 100 million mail pieces.

      A Chinese vlogger is facing widespread online backlash and a monetary fine after she livestreamed herself cooking and eating a great white shark, a protected species in China.
   
      In the clip, the livestreamer, who calls herself Tizi, shows off the shark, which is about the same size as her, and then cooks and eats it. 
   
      It was filmed last year and has since been deleted from Chinese video websites Kuaishou and Douyin.
   
      Tizi, whose surname police identified as Jin, said she bought the shark on the online shopping platform Taobao in April 2022 for 7,700 yuan ($1,150). 
   
      The video was posted in July and quickly went viral. However, the fine was only issued this week following a local investigation.
   
      Police in the city of Nanchong, Sichuan province, where she lives and where the video was filmed, confirmed that the shark in the video really was a great white. 
   
      They are a protected species under China’s wildlife protection law, which has been strengthened and expanded in recent years amid nationwide reforms regarding biodiversity conservation.
   
      Tizi’s behavior “violated the relevant provisions,” and she was given “an administrative punishment according to the law,” said the official WeChat account of the Sichuan Nanchong Market Supervision Administration.
   
      Tizi was not arrested, but she has been fined 125,000 yuan ($18,600). Her social media accounts have been removed. Meanwhile, two fishermen accused of selling sharks, surnamed Shen and Yan, were arrested, said the Sichuan Nanchong account. 
   
      The video drew horror from many Chinese social media users who condemned Tizi’s actions, with several calling for her arrest or a stronger punishment.
   
      “This is only an administrative penalty. How can we talk about animal protection?” one user wrote on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter.
   
      “Since you have done something wrong, you will suffer the consequences!” said a user on Douyin, the video platform.
   
      Others expressed distaste at the increasingly outlandish stunts done by livestreamers in a bid to gain views and followers. Livestreaming is a huge, lucrative business in China – but also highly competitive.
   
      In recent years, Chinese authorities have cracked down on the exploitation or harvesting of protected species amid several high-profile campaigns that have helped change attitudes among the public.
   
      Famously, NBA star and Chinese homegrown hero Yao Ming pledged to give up shark fin soup in 2006, campaigning for the end of illegal wildlife trade in TV ads, billboards and at public events.
   
      Shark fin soup is a traditional delicacy in Chinese cuisine and has been served in Chinese restaurants worldwide for decades. The often-expensive dish is deemed a symbol of prestige and often consumed during celebratory events like the Lunar New Year or wedding banquets.
   
      But critics have long lambasted the cruelty and unsustainability of the practice. When a shark’s fin is sliced off, it can no longer move, feed, swim or breathe; it will starve or suffocate to death on the sea floor. And when shark populations decrease, it can throw their entire ecosystems into chaos.
   
      A 2021 study found that shark and ray populations fell 71.1% from 1970 to 2018, and some species could disappear from our seas altogether.
 
      Yao Ming’s campaign and similar others appear to have worked; China banned shark fin dishes from official banquets in 2013. This, and the awareness campaigns, led to a massive drop in shark fin consumption in mainland China in the last decade, according to WildAid.

      A brutal blast of dangerously cold winds is expected to sweep across the Northeast and New England on Friday, prompting officials to close schools and activate emergency plans as the region braces for record-breaking subzero temperatures.
   
      Frigid air feeling as cold as 32 degrees Fahrenheit below zero across much of the region will combine with gusty winds, creating a nasty double whammy that could lead to frostbite in as little as 10 minutes in some areas. 
   
      “Temperatures in most regions will likely have their highest temperatures of the day before sunrise as temperatures will fall throughout the day Friday. Strong winds will bring dangerously cold temperatures, with the peak of the cold in the Northeast occurring late Friday to Saturday morning,” CNN Meteorologist Taylor Ward said. 
   
      The severe cold has put more than 15 million people in the region under wind chill warnings or advisories. Wind chill indicates how cold the air may feel, and the National Weather Service issues such warnings when winds are expected to feel as cold as 25 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. 
   
      The cold spell is expected to begin subsiding by Sunday when temperatures will likely rise again. In the meantime, officials across several states have begun imploring residents to stay indoors and have ramped up warming center efforts to accommodate some of the most vulnerable to the cold.
   
      In New York City, “code blue” has gone into effect from Friday evening due to the expected extreme cold temperatures, according to a tweet from the city’s Department of Homeless Services.
   
      It’s a designation which allows people to come into the city’s homeless shelter system on an emergency basis and directs New Yorkers to report people on the street as a safety measure.
   
      “Temperatures are to go below freezing tonight. If you see anyone at risk, especially those living on the street, please call 311,” the city’s homeless services department tweeted.
   
      As part of its outreach program, staff and providers partnered with the city will conduct outreach efforts to connect vulnerable, unsheltered New Yorkers to shelter.
   
      “No one who is experiencing homelessness and seeking shelter in New York City during a Code Blue will be denied,” a spokesperson for the department said.
   
      The city will also service “drop-in centers,” where New Yorkers experiencing unsheltered homelessness can be connected to permanent services.
   
      The Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy and service organization that helps homeless individuals and families, estimates each night there are thousands of unsheltered homeless people sleeping on New York City streets, the subway and other public areas.
   
      Farther north, officials in New York’s Erie County – home to Buffalo – also issued a code blue, which allows for those experiencing homelessness to seek shelter overnight when temperatures drop below 32 degrees. In addition to three overnight shelters in the county, there are also daytime warming centers available.
   
      Additionally, schools in Buffalo, New York, and at least three districts in Massachusetts decided to cancel classes Friday as a precautionary measure for the safety of students and staff. The city of Boston is also under a cold emergency Friday through Sunday.
   
      “With extreme weather conditions and many of our students commuting to and from school, walking and waiting for public transportation outdoors, we have made the decision to close for the day,” Boston Public Schools Superintendent Mary Skipper said in a statement. 
   
      The extreme cold is moving over Buffalo weeks after blizzard conditions wreaked havoc on Erie County during Christmas weekend, killing least 39 people. The South is also struggling with a deadly ice storm that made road conditions miserable this week, claiming the lives of at least eight people in two states. 
   
      “Please dress appropriately and don’t go out for extended periods in order to avoid frostbite or hypothermia,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said online. 
   
      In surrounding states, warming centers are expected to be available in Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Vermont, officials said.
   
Cannon Mountain Ski Resort in Franconia and Wildcat Mountain in Gorham, New Hampshire, are closed due to the extreme weather conditions, according to their Facebook pages.
   
      In Vermont, several ski areas also turned away customers and shut down operations on Friday. Jay Peak, Smugglers’ Notch, Pico and Bolton Valley all posted closures on their Facebook pages.  
 
      The extreme cold will be felt in the Midwest, too, where seven states are under wind chill alerts: Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa.
   
      “The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5 minutes,” said the National Weather Service in Duluth, Minnesota.
   
      All of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut are under wind chill alerts. Northern New Jersey, northeast Pennsylvania and much of New York state outside of New York City and Long Island are also under wind chill threat.
   
      “Very dangerous wind chills are likely and widespread wind chill warnings and advisories are already in effect for all of New England and parts of the Northeast,” the National Weather Service said Thursday. “The potential exists for numerous record low temperatures Saturday morning.”
   
      Maine will likely bear the brunt of the storm in terms of longevity as well as severity, with more than 70,000 people in the northern portion of the state under blizzard warnings, according to the National Weather Service. 
   
      “Extreme cold and wind producing dangerously low wind chills Friday into Saturday. Blizzard conditions in blowing snow across open areas,” the National Weather Service in Caribou, Maine, said. 
   
      Here’s what else is forecast in places with wind chill warnings:
   
      Elsewhere, New York City will see single-digit temperatures, with the coldest point coming Saturday morning at 8 degrees. Winds could feel as cold as 7 degrees below zero, with Friday night into Saturday being the coldest period. 
   
      Farther south, an ice storm lashed parts of several states including Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee this week. 
   
      Layers upon layers of ice, sleet and freezing rain over the course of multiple consecutive days made driving conditions life-threatening and snapped many tree branches and limbs that eventually knocked down power lines for tens of thousands. 
   
      As of early Friday, more than 250,000 homes and businesses in Texas were still without power following the storm, according to tracking site PowerOutage.us. About 60,000 homes and businesses in neighboring Arkansas were also in the dark. 
   
      The ice storm’s impact on roads made for deadly conditions this week. 
   
      In Oklahoma, two people were killed in separate crashes after they lost control of their trucks on icy roads. 
   
      And in Texas, three people were killed near Brownfield after a driver of a truck lost control Wednesday morning on an icy part of US Highway 380 and rolled into a ditch. The driver and two of his passengers were killed, the Texas Department of Public Safety said.
   
      Another driver died near Eldorado, Texas, after losing control of her truck, the public safety department said. 
   
      One person was killed in a 10-car pile up in south Austin, the city’s fire department said.
   
      In Arlington, Texas, one person was killed after their vehicle rolled over, police said.

      A West Virginia restaurant is celebrating after its beloved “Weinerman” statue was returned. 
   
      The statue was stolen from Dairy Winkle, a restaurant in Charleston, Kanawha County, West Virginia, according to a January 19 news release from the Kanawha County Sheriff’s Office. 
   
      The business suffered a fire on January 11. The restaurant owner reported that in the days after the fire, someone broke into the building and stole the statue. 
   
      The treasured statue depicts a smiling anthropomorphic hot dog licking its lips and squeezing bottles of ketchup and mustard. The sheriff’s office described the figurine as a “cherished novelty of the business” with a value of $1,000.
   
      Sheriffs received a tip about the statue’s whereabouts and found it. The statue was safely returned, undamaged, to the Dairy Winkle, according to the news release.
   
      On Facebook, the restaurant’s owner expressed gratitude for the officers who helped return the statue. “Weinerman had been found and had been safely returned to the DairyWinkle,” reads the post. “Thank you to the officers who returned him home.”
   
      A suspect has not been identified and an active investigation is underway, according to the sheriffs’ news release.

Ashley Judd says she had to re-enroll herself in trauma therapy to cope with the recent media coverage of her mother’s death.
   
      Country musician Naomi Judd, a five-time Grammy winner, died by suicide in April last year after a long battle with anxiety and depression. She was 76. 
   
      In an interview with the Guardian newspaper published Monday, Judd said she thought she was done with Eye Movement Desensitizing and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy – a type of psychotherapy used to target underlying trauma – until she was forced to revisit her trauma when media outlets published pictures of the scene of her mother’s death and the contents of a suicide note.
   
      “I re-enrolled myself … just to make sure that my healing was concretized and stout and was going to hold,” the “Double Jeopardy” actress said.
   
      Following Naomi Judd’s death, her family unsuccessfully petitioned to seal reports and recordings made by police during the course of their investigation. 
   
      Last August, Judd – who discovered her mother after she suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound – opened up about her family’s experience in an essay for the New York Times, titled “Ashley Judd: The Right to Keep Private Pain Private.” 
 
      “The trauma of discovering and then holding her laboring body haunts my nights,” she wrote at the time. “As my family and I continue to mourn our loss, the rampant and cruel misinformation that has spread about her death, and about our relationships with her, stalks my days.”
   
      Judd is now lobbying for a change to Tennessee law to limit access to confidential records pertaining to non-criminal deaths, to prevent other families from going through the same trauma.
   
      “The dark past, in God’s hands, becomes our greatest asset,” she said of her advocacy. “With it, we can avert misery and death for others.”
   
      However, Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government, told the Times Free Press in December that the bill would further impinge on the public’s right to have critical information related to law enforcement investigations “when police were investigating one of their own.”
   
      Despite this opposition, Judd told the Guardian she is hopeful the bill will pass when it is brought before the legislature for consideration.

      US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to Israel and the West Bank may have been in the works for weeks, but it couldn’t come at a more pressing time. 
   
      Both Palestinians and Israelis have suffered terrible bloodshed in the last few days, and fears are growing that the situation will spiral out of control. Thursday was the deadliest day for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in nearly two years, followed by a shooting near a Jerusalem synagogue Friday night, which Israel has deemed one of its worst terror attacks in recent years. 
   
      Even before the latest flare-up, the trip was expected to be prickly, as Blinken’s first visit to Israel since the installation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government – widely considered the most far-right and religious in Israeli history. 
   
      Now hope hinges on the arrival of the US top diplomat on Monday to help cool the rising temperatures on the ground.  
   
      Aside from trying to calm the situation through dialogue, one of Blinken’s main priorities will likely be to try to restore crucially important security coordination between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). 
   
      The PA announced it was severing the coordination on Thursday, following a deadly Israeli military raid in the West Bank which killed 10 people, among them militants and at least one civilian woman, according to both Israeli and Palestinian officials. The US immediately said ending security cooperation was not “the right step to take at this moment.” 
   
      The coordination is seen by many Israeli and American officials as a vital part of maintaining some level of calm, as it involves sharing of intelligence on militant activity, and also links between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. Without that coordination, Israel may not be able to tell Palestinian security forces where and when they will be operating in the West Bank, which could lead to dangerous mistakes or clashes between the two.  
   
      But the PA has been under pressure for months to cut off the coordination, often seen by Palestinians as forcing them to do Israel’s bidding on occupied territory. It has  taken such steps in the past, in 2020 severing coordination for six months when Israel announced ultimately unfulfilled plans to annex parts of the West Bank, and in 2017 briefly after Israeli police placed metal detectors at the entrances to the Haram Al-Sharif or Noble Sanctuary, known to Jews as Temple Mount, in Jerusalem. 
   
      “This security coordination is both humiliating and ineffective,” Nour Odeh, a former spokeswoman for the PA, told CNN. “The PA right now is losing, not just losing control, but losing face. It has no money to pay salaries. It has no control, no ability to protect its citizens, and yet it is expected from the world to protect the occupier and coordinate with them.” 
   
      Retired Israeli Col. Michael Milshtein, former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israel Defense Intelligence, said he hopes Blinken will “leverage or pressure the PA to renew the security coordination,” adding that it would be even better if the “Egyptians and the Jordanians put their pressure on (PA  President Mahmoud) Abbas.” 
   
      Milshtein said resuming security coordination would not only “reduce the general tension,” but send a signal to Palestinian militant groups that rival the PA. 
   
      “It’s also going to signal to other organizations, players like (militant groups) Hamas and Islamic Jihad, that there is no vacuum that they can get in and use it to promote their terror attacks. And that the old rules of the game are preserved,” he said. 
   
      But Odeh said pushing the Palestinians back toward coordination “won’t be an easy sell, because that will mean a loss… in the eyes of Palestinians.” 
   
      Blinken’s first stop is in Israel, where he will meet with Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials. 
   
      It’s during these meetings, both Milshtein and Odeh said, that Blinken should put the pressure on Netanyahu to resist the more extremist wings of his cabinet, some of whom have called for the dismantling of the PA, while others have called for the death penalty for those Israel accuses of terrorism. 
   
      The Israeli government, in response to two shooting attacks in Jerusalem that killed seven civilians and injured five, rolled out a series of measures including plans to demolish the homes of the attackers and drafting legislation to revoke Israeli identity cards and residency of families of those Israel has accused of terrorism, practices critics say are forms of collective punishment proscribed by international law. 
   
      “I know how complex is the current government, it’s not easy to promote strategy or promote even negotiations with the Palestinians. But in the end of the day, (Netanyahu) should understand that we’re standing between bad and worse alternatives,” Milshtein said. 
   
      Blinken should also demand Israel changes its policies toward the PA, Milshtein said, especially moves that negatively impact the economic health of the territories. 
   
      “I think that right now the PA is in a very fragile and very weak status, every punishment or economic punishment, will actually undermine and damage more the stability of the PA,” Milshtein said. “Although the PA causes a lot of problems to Israel… we have much more profits from the existence of the PA than from its vanishing.” 
   
      Odeh said Blinken needs to show Netanyahu that Israeli military operations in the West Bank, which have increased over the past year in response to a series of attacks targeting Israelis, are only making things worse. Last year was the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, and for Israelis, in nearly two decades. 
   
      “They can tell this government that this modus operandi doesn’t work. You can’t keep pushing Palestinians like that. You can’t have more than 30 Palestinians killed in less than a month [as has happened in January]. You can’t demolish homes – that will expel families – and [impose] collective punishment measures,” Odeh said. 
   
      “It won’t be long before Palestinians say, ‘You know what, we have to also organize and defend ourselves … nobody’s there to help us. So we’re going to do it ourselves.’ When you get there, nobody can put a lid on that,” Odeh said. 
   
      Hopes are not high that Blinken’s visit will dampen the smoldering embers in Israel and the Palestinian territories, especially as the Ramadan and Passover holidays approach, traditionally a period that has led to clashes in Jerusalem. 
   
      “Right now, the temperature, the atmosphere on the ground is very high. So you need only one spark to really bring a broad explosion,” Milshtein said.

Saudi Arabia: #I_hate_the_niqab 
 
      A hashtag decrying the Islamic face veil, or niqab, was trending in Saudi Arabia on Monday, leading to a flood of tweets in defense of the covering. 
   
      While “I hate the niqab” was trending, few posts were seen supporting the hashtag, with most instead defending the veil. Many, particularly men, called for women to respect Islamic customs. Others saw it as an attack on their faith and called for women to keep away from feminist ideas. 
   
      “Some (women) say that the world is changing and within five years we won’t be seeing the niqab or the hijab (head covering)… that people should be judged by the Creator, not other people,” said a man in a video posted on Twitter. “It’s better for you (woman) to be quiet and not talk about religion from an ignorant perspective.” 
   
      Most Muslims don’t consider the face veil to be mandatory under Islamic law, and the covering is only worn by deeply conservative Muslims.  
   
      Saudi Arabia has been undergoing an immense social change, driven by the government, which has seen it ease restrictions on women’s dress, gender mixing and live entertainment, all of which were previously seen as taboo. The religious police, who once roamed the streets to enforce the rules, have had their coercive powers significantly reduced in recent years. 
   
      It is unclear how the hashtag was started, but bot activity to promote certain topics is not uncommon in the kingdom. Twitter has in the past shut down thousands of accounts in Saudi Arabia for bot activity. 
   
      The face veil, which is also known as the burqa in some Muslim countries, has been banned in several European countries.

      Elizabeth Holmes made an “attempt to flee the country” by booking a one-way ticket to Mexico departing in January 2022, shortly after the Theranos founder was convicted of fraud, prosecutors alleged in a new court filing Friday.
   
      Holmes was convicted last January of defrauding investors while running the failed blood testing startup Theranos. In November, she was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison. She has appealed her conviction and does not start her prison sentence until this spring, a waiting period that prosecutors described as “generous” and due to her being pregnant.
   
      The claim that she tried to leave the country last year surfaced as part of a new filing from prosecutors arguing that Holmes should begin serving her prison sentence rather than living on an estate reported to have $13,000 in monthly expenses for upkeep.
   
      In the filing, prosecutors argue Holmes has not shown convincing evidence that she is not a flight risk, as her lawyers have stated, and used the alleged 2022 incident to support their concerns that she could pose such a risk.
   
      “The government became aware on January 23, 2022, that Defendant Holmes booked an international flight to Mexico departing on January 26, 2022, without a scheduled return trip,” the court filing states. “Only after the government raised this unauthorized flight with defense counsel was the trip canceled.”
   
      The filing adds that prosecutors anticipate Holmes will “reply that she did not in fact leave the country as scheduled” but said “it is difficult to know with certainty” what she would have done “had the government not intervened.” Now, in the wake of her sentencing, prosecutors say “the incentive to flee has never been higher” and Holmes “has the means to act on that incentive.” 
   
      An attorney for Holmes did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on the filing Friday. 
   
      The court filing includes an email from one of Holmes’ attorneys to the prosecution, claiming that the travel reservation was made before the verdict. In the email, Holmes’ attorney claims the former Theranos CEO hoped the verdict would be different and that she would be able to make this trip to attend the wedding of friends in Mexico.
   
      In an earlier court filing, Holmes’ attorneys argued for her release from custody pending appeal, saying she was not a flight risk or a threat to the community.
   
      Holmes has been ordered to turn herself into custody on April 27, 2023, at which point her prison sentence will begin. 
   
      “There are not two systems of justice – one for the wealthy and one for the poor – there is one criminal justice system in this country,” prosecutors stated in the filing. They argue that “under that system, the time has come” for Holmes to answer for her crimes.
   
      Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos attracted top investors and retail partners with claims that it had developed technology to test for a wide range of conditions using just a few drops of blood. The company began to unravel after a Wall Street Journal investigation in 2015 reported that Theranos had only ever performed roughly a dozen of the hundreds of tests it offered using its proprietary technology, and with questionable accuracy.

      Rupert Murdoch has abandoned plans to combine Fox Corporation and News Corporation, a move that would have reunited his broadcasting and print publishing companies under one roof.
   
      The companies said in nearly identical press releases that they had received a letter from Murdoch indicated that both he, and his son Lachlan, determined a combination of the two companies was not “optimal” for shareholders at this time.
   
      Fox Corporation operates the right-wing channel Fox News, in addition to Fox Sports and Fox TV Stations. News Corporation is the parent of The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, HarperCollins, and other iconic print publications. 
   
      The companies said that their special committees that had been created to examine the possible merger had been dissolved and thanked them for their “efforts on this matter.” 
   
      It’s unclear why Murdoch has chosen to suddenly abandon the deal. But not everyone was on board with his proposal. Independent Franchise Partners, a significant investor in Murdoch’s companies, said in late November that it opposed the deal.
   
      Murdoch had proposed the deal last fall, nearly a decade after Fox Corporation and News Corporation split apart in 2013.
   
      His move to reunite the two arms of his media empire came after he sold most of his Fox assets to Disney in 2019.

      The scent of fresh debate is in the air, over who should win and who should not, which nomination was the biggest surprise and, of course, which omission was the biggest snub.
   
      What is pop culture if not the cause for some folks to be up in arms?
   
      Here’s how that sentiment factors into this week’s newsletter.
   
      The death of 27-year-old British singer/songwriter Amy Winehouse from alcohol intoxication in 2011 gutted me.
   
      With her haunting voice — she was a blues singer trapped in a pop world as far as I’m concerned — and troubled life, it was hard not to grieve her passing at such a young age. I even wrote about her continued importance to the music industry a decade after her death.
   
      Now a planned biopic of her life, “Back to Black,” has many fans upset.
   
      One of the many complaints seems to be that the actress cast as Winehouse, Marisa Abela, doesn’t resemble her enough to carry the role. Portraying a star with such an iconic aesthetic as Winehouse can be almost impossible to pull off, after all.
   
      And there’s something to be said about the reverence we afford many deceased stars. Some people weren’t happy with recent portrayals of the late Whitney Houston by Naomi Ackie in “Whitney Houston: I Want to Dance With Somebody” or Austin Butler as The King in “Elvis” (despite much critical acclaim — and, yes, an Oscar nom — for the latter).
   
      Even when the actor manages to land the look, like Rami Malek’s Oscar-winning turn as the late singer Freddie Mercury in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” or has the endorsement of the subject’s family, as Butler had with the Presleys, some viewers can’t be won over.  
   
      My theory is that, because of the way we often hold celebrities who have died forever frozen in time at the height of their fame, it’s hard for actors to garner widespread support for ‘resurrecting’ them. Because nothing and no one will ever touch the original. 
   
      Will we see the luck of the Irish at this year’s Oscars?
   
      Ireland has much to be proud of this awards season. The coming-of-age tale, “The Quiet Girl,” made a wee bit of Academy Awards history as the first Irish film to be nominated in the international feature category. 
   
      And the history didn’t stop there. 
   
      Set in 1923 on a fictitious island off the coast of Ireland, “The Banshees of Inisherin,” scored nine Oscar nominations, including in the acting categories for actors Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan. Those nominations bested the seven earned in the past by “Belfast” and “In the Name of the Father.” 
   
      Irish actor Paul Mescal also scored a nod in the best actor category for his role in “Aftersun,” while the comedy “An Irish Goodbye” was nominated in the live-action short category.
   
      I’m raising a pint of the black stuff to all the nominees.
   
      Continuing with the international theme I didn’t know I needed, British singer/songwriter Sam Smith has a new album out now.
   
      “Gloria” comes more than a decade after Smith slayed as the guest vocalist on Disclosure’s hit single “Latch.” That was followed by their debut album “In the Lonely Hour” in 2014, “The Thrill of It All” in 2017, and “Love Goes” in 2020.
   
      The record includes collaborations with Kim Petras — their duet “Unholy,” a TikTok favorite, made history by making them the first openly non-binary and transgender artists to top the Billboard Hot 100 —  Ed Sheeran, Jessie Reyez and the Jamaican musician Koffee.
   
‘Shotgun Wedding’ 
 
      I don’t feel like I have to say much to sell a rom-com starring Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel as a couple whose entire wedding party is taken hostage during their destination celebration. So I won’t. 
   
      Except to say it also stars Jennifer Coolidge, Cheech Marin and Lenny Kravitz, among others. If ever there was a dream cast!
   
      “Shotgun Wedding” is streaming now on Amazon Prime.
   
‘Death by Fame’
 
      Bright lights, big city and murder.
   
      Lots of folks come to Hollywood seeking fame only to find tragedy. That’s the gist of this new ID series (ID, which stands for Investigation Discovery, is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery) that’s currently airing and streaming on Discovery+.
   
      The first episode looks at the murder of sex therapist and ex-fiancée of “Price Is Right” host Drew Carey, Amie Harwick. 
   
‘How I Met Your Father’
 
      I have three words for you when it comes to season two of “How I Met Your Father” on Hulu: Neil Patrick Harris.
   
      Harris is reprising his “How I Met Your Mother” role as Barney Stinson in the spinoff series, but that’s just about all we know so far — Hulu is keeping details of his return under wraps. But surely he’ll still be a snarky womanizer?
   
      The first episode of the show’s second season is streaming now.

      In true New York City fashion, Julia Fox’s apartment is a little tight on space. 
   
      The “Uncut Gems” star (and model, and upcoming author, according to her interviews) posted a tour of her apartment to TikTok on Wednesday. The video has garnered over 8 million views as of Friday afternoon.
   
      “I never thought in a million years I’d do this, but I do believe in maximum transparency,” said the actress, 32, at the start of the video. “I know I’m gonna get roasted, and whatever, but hopefully maybe someone can watch this and be like, ‘Okay, maybe I’m not doing so bad.’”
   
      Fox started in the living room, where she has relocated her bed so that she can use her own bedroom as a playroom for her 2-year-old son Valentino.
   
      She then showed off her “tiny” bathroom and cramped kitchen. “I also have shoeboxes in the kitchen, which is very common for New Yorkers,” she said.
   
      Finally, she showed her son’s room, complete with a lofted bed. “I put the most effort in this room, I think,” she said. “However, he does not hang out in here at all. He only wants to be in mama’s room.”
   
      Fox used the down-to-earth tour as an opportunity to discuss her views on wealth and income inequality.
   
      “I don’t like excessive displays of wealth. They make me feel icky,” she said. “Especially people that have really big houses, it’s just really wasteful when there’s so many homeless people in this country.”
   
      In the comments, fans described about how refreshing and realistic Fox’s apartment tour was. 
   
      “A relatable icon,” wrote comedian Hannah Berner.
   
      But there’s at least one downside to Fox’s cozy abode: An uninvited roommate. 
   
      “We do have a small mouse problem,” she said. “It’s a problem depending on how you look at it. I kind of let them rock, i appreciate that they at night while we’re sleeping, they come up and clean up the crumbs that my son drops on the floor, so yeah, I’m not going to evict the mice any time soon.”
   
      In the caption, she clarified that there is only “ONE mouse, and he’s cute.”

      House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark’s daughter was arrested during a protest in Boston and has been arraigned on charges including assault on a police officer.  
   
      Riley Dowell, 23, was found by police tagging the Parkman Bandstand monument “NO COP CITY” and “ACAB,” according to a press release from the Boston Police Department. “ACAB” is commonly known as an acronym for the anti-police slogan “All Cops Are Bastards.”
   
      While police tried to arrest Dowell, protesters surrounded officers and one was hit in the face and bleeding, according to the press release. The release referred to Dowell by her birth name.
   
      Dowell has now been arraigned and charged with assault of a police officer, according to a news release from Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden’s office.  
   
      “Riley Dowell, 23, was arraigned in the Central Division of Boston Municipal Court today on charges of assault and battery on a police officer, vandalizing property, tagging property, vandalizing a historic marker/monument, and resisting arrest,” the release obtained by CNN affiliate WCVB said. “Judge James Coffey set bail at $500 and ordered Dowell to stay away from Boston Common.”  
   
      Dowell is represented by attorney Chris Dearborn, according to the release. Dearborn had no comment when reached by CNN. Dowell’s next court appearance is scheduled for April 19, the release said. 
   
      Dowell posted bail and is no longer in police custody, the Boston Municipal Court told CNN in an email Tuesday. 
   
      Clark commented on the news in a tweet Sunday.
 
      “Last night, my daughter was arrested in Boston, Massachusetts. I love Riley, and this is a very difficult time in the cycle of joy and pain in parenting,” Clark wrote. “This will be evaluated by the legal system, and I am confident in that process.”
   
      Clark began serving as minority whip in the 118th session of Congress after House Democrats elevated her to the position.
   
      Clark is only the second woman after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to serve in one of the top two party leadership positions in Congress.
   
      Previously, the congresswoman served in the leadership role of assistant speaker.

      Regina King has paid tribute to her late son, Ian Alexander Jr., nearly one year after his death.
   
      King on Instagram Thursday shared video of a lantern glowing in the sky on what would have been Alexander’s 27th birthday.
   
      “January 19th is Ian’s Worthday,” she captioned the video. “As we still process his physical absence, we celebrate his presence. We are all in different places on the planet…so is Ian. His spirit is the thread that connects us.”
   
      Alexander died by suicide at age 26.
   
      He was an accomplished musician and DJ who performed as “Desduné” and had released a new single, “Green Eyes,” shortly before his passing.
   
      “Of course orange is your favorite color…Its the fire and the calm. I see you in everything I breath. My absolute favorite thing about myself is being ….Regina the mother of Ian the GodKing. Continue to shine bright, my guiding light,” King wrote.
   
      Several of King’s friends and industry colleagues shared their love and support.
   
      Ava DuVernay commented on the post with a quote, “I’ll choose for myself next time who I’ll reach out and take as mine, in the way I might stand at a fruit stall having decided to ignore the apples, the mangoes and the kiwis. But hold my hands above a pile of oranges as if to warm my skin before a fire.- Roisin Kelly” 
   
      Justin Theroux joined in with, “Love you Regina. Sending you more,” adding a heart emoji.

      Tyre Nichols, who was laid to rest on Wednesday, was killed for driving while Black. The former Memphis police officers fired for his killing will get an opportunity to defend themselves in court against the criminal charges, as they should. Nichols got no such opportunity.
   
      So often in cases like these, the victim is on trial. But here, not only has the Memphis Police Department deemed the force used to detain him excessive, it also stated that there is no evidence that Nichols was even driving recklessly, the asserted reason he was stopped in the first place. Since the firing of the five police officers charged in his death, two additional officers have been relieved of duty, as have three EMT workers.
   
      The question we should be asking now is, why are Black people stopped so often for traffic violations? Why are so many across the United States dying at the hands, or tasers or guns of police officers during these stops? And what can be done to change this horrific situation?
   
      Here’s one thing we know: Body cameras are not the answer. Body camera footage is not prevention; there was body camera footage of Nichols’ killing. It is evidence, not a prophylactic.
   
      Even the concern about the release of the footage – a fear that protests could turn into conflict, or an uprising – is evidence of society’s failure to make good on the promises of reform after the murder in Minneapolis of George Floyd nearly three years ago. 
   
      The scope of the problem is immense: Study after study has shown that Black people are overpoliced when it comes to traffic stops. Stanford researchers gathered data on 100 million traffic stops between 2011 and 2017. One hundred million.
   
      They found that Black and Latino drivers are much more likely to be stopped and searched for less reason and even though more illegal items are found on white drivers who are stopped and searched.
   
      These conclusions get repeated in many studies. A South Carolina study of 14 years of police stops showed that Black drivers are 63% more likely to be stopped and 115% more likely to be searched than white drivers, even though they drive less.
   
      Police officers in Grand Rapids, Michigan shot Patrick Lyoya, a 26-year-old Black man, in the back of the head after he was stopped for having a license plate that didn’t match the car he was driving. A former police officer, who claims he shot Lyoya in self defense, is facing trial in the case and has been charged with second degree murder.   
   
      A Michigan study showed Black people were significantly more likely to be stopped than White people. Most recently, Keenan Anderson, a teacher, recently died from being shocked with a Taser repeatedly by a Los Angeles Police officer. Anderson had flagged down officers at a traffic collision. His relatives have filed a $50 million lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, which declined to comment on the suit.
   
      A California study of 4 million traffic stops found Black people much more likely to be searched (20%) than White people (8%), even though slightly more contraband is found on White people during stops.
   
      According to Mapping Police Violence, a non-profit research program, 10% of police killings each year happen during traffic stops. Black drivers are 28% of the people police have killed, while only being 13% of the population. 
   
      A New York Times investigation in 2021 found that, over a five year period, 600 people were killed by police during traffic stops. Don’t think this is about public safety. It found that 400 of the drivers or passengers killed had no weapon, nor were being pursued for a violent crime.
   
      Police killings have not declined since George Floyd’s murder. We have heard cries for more police and policing in light of some upticks in certain categories of crime. We have too rarely heard discussion of how often Black people pay the price for racial stereotypes, especially when simply driving a car. 
   
      The infamous Scorpion Unit, to which the officers who killed Tyre Nichols belonged, has been disbanded. Calls to dismantle “street crime” units like this have occurred in other parts of the country where wrongful stops and searches and harassment have plagued Black communities. 
   
      We police Blackness, too often, and real crime too seldom. As for traffic stops, we don’t need to ask police officers to spend their time on broken tail lights, or other small infractions that do not require a badge and a gun. 
   
      And importantly, officers who violate the rules that govern them must be disciplined, including White police officers, who are less likely to be disciplined than Black officers. Consistency in discipline matters when any officer violates their training or the patrol guide rules and for lying, which is all too common to cover up their own violations.
   
      The truth is we have the solutions, we just need the will to be fair and just so that we are all, including Black drivers, safe. There are many steps we can and should take to make it safe to drive while Black. The Vera Institute has documented and suggested reforms. 
   
      One is to take armed police out of the business of policing low level infractions. Philadelphia took this step last year. Some cities have cameras that catch and send tickets for speeding. And not-for-profit in Minneapolis is giving vouchers to fix broken head or tail lights, to reduce contact with police.
   
      The federal government can use the carrot of grants to help cities create safe, alternative ways to address low level violations and the stick of requiring tracking and addressing discriminatory policing that results in Black harassment and harm. Putting an end to that Black harm would be a fitting tribute to the memory of Tyre Nichols.

      Dave Bautista is looking for his next role, and he’d love for it to be a chance to show off his softer side. 
 
      The former wrestler told Page Six on Monday that while he knows he’s “not your typical rom-com lead,” he’d love to be considered for a film in that genre.
   
      “I’m a little rough around the edges,” the “Knock at the Cabin” actor said. “But I always, you know, I look in the mirror and I say, I ask myself, ‘Am I that unattractive? Is there something that unappealing about me that excludes me from these parts?’”
   
      The actor, who is most known for the part of alien Drax in Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” film franchise, lamented that rom-com roles “just never come my way.”
   
      “I still have high hopes. I’ll just keep searching,” he concluded. 
   
      After the release of horror-thriller “Knock at the Cabin” this week, from director M. Night Shyamalan, Bautista will next be seen in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” later this spring.
   
      Bautista has previously expressed “relief” that the new Marvel film wraps up that franchise.
   
      “I just don’t know if I want Drax to be my legacy,” he told GQ in January. “it’s a silly performance, and I want to do more dramatic stuff.”
   
      Bautista in recent years has largely taken on roles that show off his comedy chops, like in “My Spy” and “Stuber.” He also appeared in “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.”

      Alan Cumming has returned a prestigious royal award in an effort to sever his association with the “toxicity” of the British Empire.
   
      “Today is my 58th birthday and I want to tell you about something I recently did for myself. I returned my OBE,” the Scottish actor said in an Instagram post on Friday.  
   
      The Officer of the British Empire (OBE) award is given to individuals who make a positive impact in their field.
   
      In the post, Cumming recounted how “fourteen years ago, [he] was incredibly grateful to receive it in the 2009 Queen’s birthday honours list.”
   
      Cumming received the honor in recognition of his services to film, theater and the arts. His four-decade movie and TV career has included starring roles in “Annie,” “X-Men 2,” “the “Spy Kids” franchise and “The Good Wife.” In 1998, he won a Best Actor Tony award for his performance as the Emcee in the Broadway musical “Cabaret.”
   
      The OBE also recognized his “activism for equal rights for the gay and lesbian community” in America.
   
      Cumming, who is bisexual, has participated in a number of campaigns advocating for the equal rights of LGBT people, on behalf of organizations like the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD).  
   
      Despite feeling “shocked” and “delighted” at the time to receive the honor, Cumming described how the death of Queen Elizabeth last September made him reflect on the honor he had received – and the institution that bestowed it upon him.
   
      “The Queen’s death and the ensuing conversations about the role of monarchy and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes,” the actor said.
   
      He added that he was now grateful that the “times and laws in the US have changed,” referencing the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act that prevented federal recognition of same sex marriages.
   
      “Thankfully, times and laws in the US have changed, and the great good the award brought to the LGBTQ+ cause back in 2009 is now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire (OBE stands for Officer of the British Empire),” he added.
   
      Cumming’s post comes amid a growing backlash against the monarchy for its role in British imperial history. In 2021, Barbados became the first country in nearly 20 years to cast off the Crown. The prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda also announced in September plans to hold a referendum on whether to remove King Charles III as the head of state.
   
      In December, the royal family was embroiled in a racism scandal, after Lady Susan Hussey, the Queen’s lady in waiting for more than 60 years, repeatedly asked a Black British charity boss where she was really “from.”
   
      “I returned my award, explained my reasons and reiterated my great gratitude for being given it in the first place. I’m now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again,” Cumming concluded.
   
      “Happy birthday to me!”

      Although we’re almost past the point of having the stench of death surround movies when they head directly to streaming, that assessment applies to “Shotgun Wedding,” which loads both barrels with Jennifer Lopez, late-replacement Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Coolidge and still fires blanks. The movie arrives in the US via Amazon, but even that invitation is worth declining.
   
      Even for an action comedy, this Lopez-produced effort is inordinately skewed toward putting everything that might entice someone to watch in the trailer, beginning with the shot of Coolidge hoisting an automatic weapon to defend the wedding party. As hot as she is off “The White Lotus,” she can’t redeem the tiresome execution.
   
      The film thus becomes perhaps most interesting for its behind-the-scenes footnote, which was the casting of Duhamel to replace Armie Hammer, who left the project in 2021 after problematic accounts regarding his interactions with various women. Those questions regarding his social-media posts were detailed in the recent docuseries “House of Hammer.”
 
      The casting switch certainly isn’t the problem, although one can quibble with the math on Coolidge playing Duhamel’s mom. The larger misstep is stranding the cast in a beautiful locale (the Dominican Republic, standing in for the Philippines) and packing such a moth-eaten script for the trip.
   
      Duhamel’s Tom, a baseball player, has planned every aspect of his destination wedding to Darcy (Lopez), which is set to take place on a private island. While the two are alone bickering – triggered by the arrival of her suave ex-boyfriend (Lenny Kravitz), who has shown up without having RSVPed – a group of heavily armed pirates show up, taking everyone else in the wedding party hostage.
   
      The masked intruders (masks are a good idea given the movie’s merits) want Darcy’s wealthy dad (Cheech Marin) to sign over millions as payment. But he won’t until he knows Darcy is safe, as she and Tom awkwardly leap into Rambo mode, fighting a guerrilla war against the pirates while continuing to argue during their down moments.
   
      Directed by Jason Moore (“Pitch Perfect”), there are a few fairly impressive stunts (again, all of them in the trailer) sprinkled along the way, such as Darcy and Tom trying to zipline to safety. For the most part, though, this is a slapdash effort on most every level, seemingly sold almost entirely on the notion of watching Lopez run through the jungle in a tattered wedding dress.
   
      Lopez’s last underwhelming marriage-themed rom-com, “Marry Me,” premiered simultaneously on the streaming service Peacock and in theaters, which underscores the challenging commercial landscape for this genre, setting quality issues aside.
   
      While the movie will get a theatrical release in some territories outside the US, “Shotgun Wedding’s” streaming debut at least spares those responsible from one likely box-office indignity: Throwing a big, lavish party, and having almost nobody show up.
   
“Shotgun Wedding” premieres January 27 on Amazon in the US and in select theaters globally. It’s rated R.

      Cancer deaths are on the decline in the United States, and the outlook for winning the war against this deadly disease is both good and bad.
   
      In the United States, deaths from cancer have dropped 33% since 1991, with an estimated 3.8 million lives saved, mostly due to advances in early detection and treatment. Still, 10 million people worldwide lost their lives to cancer in 2020.
   
      During the last three years, cancer has remained a leading cause of death in the world — more than Covid-19, said Dr. Arif Kamal, chief patient officer for the American Cancer Society. 
   
      Symptoms of cancer can mimic those of many other illnesses, so it can be difficult to tell them apart, experts say. Signs include unexplained weight loss or gain, swelling or lumps in the groin, neck, stomach or underarms and fever and night sweats, according to the National Cancer Institute.
   
      Bladder, bowel, skin and neurological issues may be signs of cancer, such as changes in hearing and vision, seizures, headaches and bleeding or bruising for no reason, the institute said. But most cancers do not cause pain at first, so you can’t rely on that as a sign.
   
      “We tell patients that if they have symptoms that do not get better after a few weeks, they should visit a doctor,” Kamal said. “It doesn’t mean the diagnosis will be cancer, however.”
   
      Rather than wait for symptoms, the key to keeping cancer at bay is prevention, along with screenings to detect the disease in its early stages. That’s critical, experts say, as new cases of cancer are on the rise globally.
 
      A surprising number of new diagnoses are in people under 50, according to a 2022 review of available research by Harvard University scientists. 
   
      Cases of breast, colon, esophagus, gallbladder, kidney, liver, pancreas, prostate, stomach and thyroid cancers have been increasing in 50-, 40- and even 30-year-olds since the 1990s.
   
      That’s unusual for a disease that typically strikes people over 60, Kamal said. “Cancer is generally considered an age-related condition, because you’re giving yourself enough time to have sort of a genetic whoopsie.”
   
      Older cells experience decades of wear and tear from environmental toxins and less than favorable lifestyle choices, making them prime candidates for a cancerous mutation.
   
      “We believed it takes time for that to occur, but if someone is 35 when they develop cancer, the question is ‘What could possibly have happened?’” Kamal asked.
   
      No one knows exactly, but smoking, alcohol consumption, air pollution, obesity, a lack of physical activity and a diet with few fruits and vegetables are key risk factors for cancer, according to the World Health Organization.
   
      Add those up, and you’ve got a potential culprit for the advent of early cancers, the Harvard researchers said.
   
      “The increased consumption of highly processed or westernized foods together with changes in lifestyles, the environment … and other factors might all have contributed to such changes in exposures,” the researchers wrote in their 2022 review.
   
      “You don’t need 65 years of eating crispy, charred or processed meat as a main diet, for example,” Kamal added. “What you need is about 20 years, and then you start to see stomach and colorectal cancers, even at young ages.”
   
      So how do you fight back against the big C? Start in your 20s, Kamal said.
   
      Many of the most common cancers, including breast, bowel, stomach and prostate, are genetically based — meaning that if a close relative has been diagnosed, you may have inherited a predisposition to develop that cancer too.
   
      That’s why it’s critical to know your family’s health history. Kamal suggested that young people sit down with their grandparents and other close relatives and ask them about their illnesses — and then write it down. 
   
      “The average person doesn’t actually know the level of granularity that is helpful in accessing risk,” he said. 
   
      “When I talk to patients, what they’ll say is, ‘Oh, yeah, Grandma had cancer.’ There’s two questions I want to know: At what age was the cancer diagnosed, and what specific type of cancer was it? I need to know if she had cancer in her 30s or 60s, because it determines your level of risk. But they often don’t know.”
   
      The same applies to the type of cancer, Kamal said. 
   
      “People often say ‘Grandma had bone cancer.’ Well, multiple myeloma and osteosarcoma are bone cancers, but both of them are relatively rare,” he said. “So I don’t think Grandma had bone cancer. I think Grandma had another cancer that went to the bone, and I need to know that.”
   
      Next, doctors need to know what happened to that relative. Was the cancer aggressive? What was the response to treatment?
   
      “If I hear Mom or Grandma was diagnosed with breast cancer at 40 and passed away at 41, then I know that cancer is very aggressive, and that changes my sense of your risk. I may add additional tests that aren’t in the guidelines for your age.”
   
Cancer screening guidelines are based on population-level assessments, not individual risk, Kamal said. If cancer (or other conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, or even migraines) runs in the family, you become a special case and need a personalized plan.
   
      “And I will tell you the entire scientific community is observing this younger age shift for different cancers and is asking itself: ‘Should guidelines be more deliberate and intentional for younger populations to give them some of this advice?’ “
   
      If your family history is clear of cancer, that lowers your risk — but doesn’t remove it. You can decrease the likelihood of cancer by eating a healthy, plant-based diet, getting the recommended amount of exercise and sleep, limiting alcohol consumption and not smoking or vaping, experts say.
   
Protecting yourself from the sun and tanning beds is key, too, as harmful ultraviolet rays damage DNA in skin cells and are the prime risk factor for melanoma. However, skin cancer can show up even where the sun doesn’t shine, Kamal said.
   
      “There’s been an increase of melanoma that’s showing up in non-sun-exposed areas such as the underarm, the genital area and between the toes,” he said. “So it’s important to check — or have a partner or dermatologist check — your entire body once a year.”
   
Skin check: Take off all your clothes and look carefully at all of your skin, including the palms, soles of feet, between toes and buttocks and in the genital area. Use the A, B, C, D, E method to analyze any worrisome spots and then see a specialist if you have concerns, the American Academy of Dermatology advised. 
   
      Also see a dermatologist if you have any itching, bleeding or see a mole that looks like an “ugly duckling” and stands out from the rest of the spots on your body.
   
Get vaccinated if you haven’t: Two vaccinations protect against cervical and liver cancers, and others for cancers such as melanoma are in development.
   
      Hepatitis B is transmitted via blood and sexual fluids and can cause liver cancer and cirrhosis, which is a scarred and damaged liver. A series of three shots, starting at birth, is part of the US recommended childhood vaccines schedule. Unvaccinated adults should check with their doctor to see if they are eligible.
   
      The HPV vaccine protects against several strains of human papillomavirus, the most common sexually transmitted infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   
Human papillomavirus can cause deadly cervical cancer as well as vaginal, anal and penile cancer. It can also cause cancer in the back of the throat, including the tongue and tonsils. 
   
      “These HPV-related head and neck cancers are more aggressive than the non-HPV-related cancers,” Kamal said, “so boys as well as girls should be vaccinated.”
   
      Since the vaccine’s approval in 2006 in the US for adolescents ages 11 to 13, cervical cancer rates have declined by 87%. Today, the vaccine can be given through age 45, the CDC said.
 
Breast self-exams: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer diagnosed worldwide, according to the WHO, followed by lung, colorectal, prostate, skin and stomach cancers.
   
      Both men and women can get breast cancer, so men with a family history should be aware of the symptoms as well, experts say. These include pain, redness or irritation, dimpling, thickening or swelling of any part of the breast. New lumps, either in the breast or armpit, any pulling in of the nipple and nipple discharge other than breast milk are also worrisome symptoms, the CDC said.
 
      Women should do a self-exam once a month and see a doctor if there are any warning signs, the National Breast Cancer Association advised. Choose a time when the breasts will be less tender and lumpy, which is about seven to 10 days after the beginning of the menstrual flow. 
   
Screenings and tests: At-home exams and vaccinations can save lives, but many cancers can only be detected through laboratory tests, scans or biopsies. The American Cancer Society has a list of recommended screening by ages.
   
      Getting those done in a timely manner increases the chance for early detection and treatment, but it’s still each person’s responsibility to know their risk factors, Kamal said.
   
      “Remember, guidelines are only for people at average risk,” he said. “The only way someone can know whether the guidelines apply to them is to really understand their family history.”

393,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Alicia Wallace,Why did we get a monster jobs report if the economy is slowing?,The economy wasn't supposed to add half a million jobs in January.,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/04/economy/strong-jobs-report-weakening-economy-analysis/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230203154918-us-labor-market-jobs-report.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-02-04T16:56:32Z,"
      The economy wasn’t supposed to add half a million jobs in January.
   
      In fact, a consensus poll of 81 economists expected job gains to land at around 185,000, according to Refinitiv. After 11 months of aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, the experts were naturally expecting the economy’s job gains to slow as higher borrowing costs percolated through the economy, slowing investment and growth and pushing companies to pull back on spending and hiring. 
   
      And yet, even though it seemed impossible, the labor market is somehow getting tighter, said Rucha Vankudre, senior economist at business analytics firm Lightcast.
   
      “I think pretty much all the labor economists in the country this morning are shocked,” Vankudre said Friday during a webinar after the jobs report was released. I think the question on everyone’s mind is, ‘How can the labor market keep getting stronger and stronger, and how can this keep happening while at the same time we are seeing prices come down?’”
   
      Instead of lending credence to what was a bubbling belief in a soft landing, Friday’s jobs report only seems to beg more questions about not only the state of the economy, but also of the Federal Reserve’s attempts to hammer down high inflation.
   
      On Wednesday, the Fed concluded its first policymaking meeting of 2023 by green-lighting a quarter-point interest rate hike — the smallest since March — as a reflection of progress in its fight to lower inflation. 
   
      The more moderate increase had been long telegraphed and came despite a hotter-than-expected December Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report, which showed job openings grew to more than 11 million, or 1.9 available jobs for every job seeker.
   
      Fed officials remain laser focused on wages and inflation, and are seeing some progress there, said Elizabeth Crofoot, Lightcast senior economist. Fluctuations are to be expected in any economic data, and it’s (always) important to remember that “one month does not make a trend,” especially for January data, she said.
   
      “I think [Fed officials] are going to say, ‘Let’s continue to keep our eye on the data,’ and they’re going to hold steady until they see that inflation rate come down,” Crofoot said. 
   
      The January jobs report shouldn’t trigger a wholesale change of what Fed members are thinking or what they were planning on doing before this report, Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN.
   
      “I think it suggests that the labor market remains still very strong, and there’s still a lot of wage pressures coming from that strong labor market that the Fed needs to contend with if it’s going to get inflation back to 2% on a sustained basis,” House said, noting the Fed’s target inflation rate.
   
      The Covid pandemic was a tremendous shock to global economies, and the US labor force is still showing the effects of historic employment losses, sudden shifts in consumer behavior, discombobulated supply chains, and efforts to return to a state of normality.
   
      The employment recovery since 2021 has been historically robust, with the monthly job gains larger than anything seen on record. 
   
      January’s jobs report came with added complexity, because it included annual updates to populations estimates and revisions to employer survey data. 
   
      “Now we know both [2021 and 2022] had faster job growth than we previously realized,” said University of Michigan economists Betsey Stevenson and Benny Doctor in a statement Friday. “The patterns remain the same: Job growth accelerated in the second half of 2021 before slowing in the first half of 2022 and slowing further in the second half of 2022.”
   
      The January reports also bring with them “seasonal noise,” said Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US.
   
      “I’m advising policymakers and clients to ignore the topline number [of 517,000],” he said, noting it’s likely a function of seasonal adjustments and a reflection of swings in hiring activity and traditional cutbacks that take place from mid-December to mid-January. 
   
      “That being said, even if a downward revision takes away 200,000 or so off the top, you still are sitting at around 300,000,” he added.
   
      “The job market is clearly too robust at this time to re-establish price stability; therefore, the Federal Reserve is going to have to not only hike by 25 basis points at its March meeting, it’s going to have to do so at the May meeting,” he predicted.
   
      Last summer, Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that “some pain” (aka rising unemployment) would likely be felt as a result of the Fed’s sweeping efforts to tackle inflation. 
   
      Yet Powell did not once utter the word “pain” during his press conference on Wednesday, said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst with Bankrate. 
   
      “If they were to put money on it, I think Las Vegas oddsmakers would be doubling down right now on the soft landing scenario — not to say that’s the base case, per se, but the chances seem to be growing,” Hamrick said. 
   
      “If anything, the global economic scenario has brightened in recent days and weeks — and we got a significant ray of sunshine with this January employment report, including all the revisions — but that’s not to say that consumers or businesses should be complacent with respect to an eventual risk of a recession,” he said. 
   
      So for now, the chances of a soft landing remain unknown.
   
      “This is sort of a bumpy, turbulent ride to who knows where,” Crofoot said.

      Climate change and antimicrobial resistance are two of the greatest threats to global health, according to a new report from the United Nations Environment Programme.
   
      The report, titled “Bracing for Superbugs,” highlights the role of climate change and other environmental factors contributing to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. It was announced Tuesday at the Sixth Meeting of the Global Leaders Group on Antimicrobial Resistance in Barbados. 
   
      Antimicrobial resistance or AMR happens when germs such as bacteria, viruses and fungi develop the ability to defeat the medications designed to kill them. 
   
      “The development and spread of AMR means that antimicrobials used to prevent and treat infections in humans, animals and plants might turn ineffective, with modern medicine no longer able to treat even mild infections,” the UN Environment Programme said in a news release. 
   
      Roughly 5 million deaths worldwide were associated with antimicrobial resistance in 2019, and the annual toll is expected to increase to 10 million by 2050 if steps aren’t taken to stop the spread of antimicrobial resistance, according to the report.
   
      In the US, there are nearly 3 million antimicrobial-resistant infections each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.
   
      Antimicrobials are commonly used in cleaning products, plant pesticides and medications to kill and prevent the spread of germs among people, animals and crops. 
   
      Drug resistance can develop naturally, but experts say the overuse of antimicrobials in people, animals and food production has accelerated the process. The microorganisms that survive these chemicals are stronger and more powerful, and they can spread their drug-resistant genes to germs that have never been exposed to antimicrobials. 
   
      The focus so far has largely been on excessive antimicrobial use, but experts say there is growing evidence that environmental factors play a significant role in the development, transmission and spread of antimicrobial resistance.
   
      “Climate change, pollution, changes in our weather patterns, more rainfall, more closely packed, dense cities and urban areas – all of this facilitates the spread of antibiotic resistance. And I am certain that this is only going to go up with time unless we take relatively drastic measures to curb this,” said Dr. Scott Roberts, an infectious diseases specialist at Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved with the new UN report. 
   
      The climate crisis worsens antimicrobial resistance in several ways. Research has shown that increased temperatures increase both the rate of bacterial growth and the rate of the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes between microorganisms. 
   
      “As we get a more extreme climate, especially as it warms, the gradients that drive the evolution of resistance will actually accelerate. So, by curbing temperature rises and reducing the extremity of events, we can actually then fundamentally curb the probability of evolving new resistance,” Dr. David Graham, a professor of ecosystems engineering at Newcastle University and one of the UN report’s authors, said at a news conference ahead of the report’s release. 
   
      Experts also say severe flooding as a result of climate change can lead to conditions of overcrowding, poor sanitation and increased pollution, which are known to increase infection rates and antimicrobial resistance as human waste, heavy metals and other pollutants in water create favorable conditions for bugs to develop resistance. 
   
      “The same drivers that cause environmental degradation are worsening the antimicrobial resistance problem. The impacts of antimicrobial resistance could destroy our health and food systems,” Inger Andersen, the UN Environment Programme’s executive director, said at the news conference.
   
      Environmental pressures are creating bugs that thrive in the human body, which experts say is unusual for some species.
   
      “There’s one hypothesis from a prominent mycologist who suggests that the reason the body’s temperature is 98.6 is because that is the temperature where fungi can’t grow that well. And so, now we’re seeing Candida auris and some of the other new microbes that have come up that really grow quite well – even at temperatures of 98.6 in the human body. And so I think climate change, really selecting for these organisms to adapt to a warmer climate, is going to increase the odds that there’s infection in humans,” Roberts said. 
   
      Such opportunistic infections jeopardize medical advancements like joint replacements, organ transplants and chemotherapy – procedures in which patients have a significant risk of infection and require effective antibiotics. 
   
      Drug-resistant infections can make treatment difficult or even impossible. Roberts says that resorting to “last-ditch treatments” is “never a good scenario from the patient level because there are reasons we don’t use them up front,” such as organ toxicity and failure.
   
      “When somebody does present with a drug-resistant bacteria or fungus and we really need to rely on one of these last-line antibiotics, it’s usually a challenge to treat from the outset. And so the patients really don’t do as well as a result,” he said. “In rare circumstances, we run out of options entirely, and in that case, there’s really nothing we can do. Fortunately, those cases remain quite rare, but I am certain that with this growing antibiotic resistance problem, we’ll see these increasing frequency over time.”
   
      Experts say that both climate change and antimicrobial resistance have been worsened by and can be improved by human actions. One critical step is to limit antibiotic overuse and misuse. 
   
      “Antibiotics and antifungals do not work on viruses, such as colds and the flu. These drugs save lives. But, anytime they are used, they can lead to side effects and antimicrobial resistance,” the UN report’s authors wrote. 
   
      The authors also emphasize that the health of people, animals, plants and the environment are closely linked and interdependent, and they call on governments to identify policies to limit antibiotic use in agriculture and reduce environmental pollution.
   
      Finally, experts say, steps to reduce climate change are steps to limit antimicrobial resistance.
   
      “Whatever we can do on an individual level to kind of reduce the impact of climate change, really, that’s kind of only worsening this problem, as well as pollution and urbanization and in dense, crowded areas. Although I know from the individual level that’s a hard thing to change,” Roberts said.

      The White House tried to flip the script on border security politics, accusing House Republicans of “staging political stunts” and undermining border security ahead of a House Oversight Committee hearing Tuesday that probed the Biden administration’s handling of the US southern border.
   
      In a memo obtained by CNN, the White House counsel’s office spokesman Ian Sams credited a series of new immigration and border security actions by the administration with reducing southern border crossings last month and slammed House Republicans for voting against the omnibus spending bill last year that included billions of dollars in border security funding and accused them of “pushing an agenda that would make border security worse.”
   
      “It is clear that House Republicans are more interested in staging political stunts than on rolling up their sleeves to work with President Biden and Democrats in Congress on legislation to strengthen border security and fix our immigration system that has needed repair for decades,” Sams wrote in the memo. “But beyond their refusal to work constructively to pursue concrete solutions, they and their allies in the states are actually pushing an agenda that would make things worse at the border.”
   
      The memo was distributed Tuesday morning to Democrats on Capitol Hill and other allies, just hours before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee held a hearing with two chief patrol agents of the US Border Patrol. 
   
      The committee’s chairman, Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, has accused the Biden administration of igniting “the worst border crisis in American history.”
   
      “Starting on day one in office, President Biden and his administration rolled back deterrent focused policies, halted the construction of the border wall, gutted interior enforcement, pushed amnesty for illegal immigrants – all of which have made it difficult for US Border Patrol agents to secure the border,” Comer said in a statement announcing Tuesday’s hearing, vowing to hold the administration accountable.
   
      Southern border crossings have hit record levels under Biden, making the issue a key political vulnerability that the newly empowered House Republican majority is eager to exploit. But Biden administration officials saw progress last month as daily migrant encounters dropped by more than half on the heels of new policies enacted by the administration.
   
      During that hearing, Republicans slammed the Biden administration over its handling of the US southern border, claiming that the administration is to blame for the uptick in fentanyl being smuggled into the country and doubling down on their intentions to investigate.
   
      “We will investigate. We will reveal the truth. And we will force accountability,” said Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana. 
   
      The back and forth between Republicans and Democrats over fentanyl in the over three-hour hearing underscored the highly political nature of the border, including over drug smuggling. 
   
      GOP lawmakers repeatedly cited so-called “gotaways” – migrants who evade capture – arguing that the thousands of known “gotaways” are evidence of what lawmakers described as an “open border” policy despite the Department of Homeland Security continuing to rely on a Trump-era border restriction that allows authorities to turn migrants away.   
   
      Democratic lawmakers on the committee, meanwhile, frequently cited data that shows fentanyl primarily comes in and is stopped at ports of entry. Republicans pushed back, saying that it’s unclear how many individuals may be carrying drugs into the United States. 
   
      “All we’re doing in this hearing is politicizing another issue in this country that doesn’t need to be politicized. We all agree that fentanyl is a problem,” said Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida. 
   
      DHS has said it’s false that migrants seeking asylum between ports of entry are bringing fentanyl, which is instead often smuggled via vehicles through ports of entry. 
   
      The White House is also putting the spotlight back on GOP state officials who are suing to end Biden administration immigration policies, including most recently a lawsuit by 20 Republican-led states to block the expansion of a program that will allow up to 30,000 migrants from Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Haiti to enter the US each month. Ending those policies “would lead to more unlawful border crossings,” the White House said.
   
      “Why won’t House Republicans stand up to Republican state attorneys general who are trying to create more unlawful border crossings by ending President Biden’s new measures for border enforcement and safe, orderly migration?” Sams asked in the memo.
   
      “House Republicans should join the President in pursuing real solutions, not political stunts – and they should answer for their opposition to funding for border security and their refusal to stand up to Republican officials trying to create more unlawful border crossings,” he added.

      If you’re wondering why Gina Prince-Bythewood’s film “The Woman King” – which stars Oscar winner Viola Davis and garnered an A+ Cinemascore – was shut out of the Oscars race this year, you’re not alone. 
   
      In a first-person article for The Hollywood Reporter published on Tuesday, Prince-Bythewood reflected on the exclusion of her film by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (the governing body responsible for the prestigious awards), which she says left her “disappointed.”
   
      “But the Academy made a very loud statement, and for me to stay quiet is to accept that statement,” she wrote, adding that she rejects the term “snub” in reference to “The Woman King” because “a snub is if it missed out on a category or two” and her film “was not nominated for one single craft.”
   
      Prince-Bythewood said that she “agreed to speak up, on behalf of Black women” who also had their work overlooked this year – like director Chinonye Chukwu and actress Danielle Deadwyler of “Till” – “and for those who haven’t even stepped on a set yet.”
   
      She wrote that “The Woman King,” which is on track to pass $100 million at the global box office, not being nominated for any category is “a reflection of where the Academy stands and the consistent chasm between Black excellence and recognition. And, sadly, this is not just an issue in Hollywood but in every industry.”
   
      The director – who was behind 2000’s “Love & Basketball” and 2020’s “The Old Guard” – also made reference to the controversy surrounding Andrea Riseborough’s surprise nomination for best actress, which some felt led to Davis being left out of the category.
   
      “My issue with what happened is how people in the industry use their social capital – screenings in their homes, personal calls, personal emails, personal connections, elevated status,” Prince-Bythewood wrote. “People like to say, ‘Well, Viola and Danielle (Deadwyler, who was also did not earn a nomination) had studios behind them.’ But we just very clearly saw that social capital is more valuable than that.”
   
      Riseborough’s eyebrow-raising nomination was held up by the Academy, following a review of the film’s celebrity-backed grassroots campaign.
   
      Prince-Bythewood lamented that “there is no groundswell from privileged people with enormous social capital to get behind Black women. There never has been.”
   
      For its part, the Academy has made efforts in recent years to expand and diversify its membership, following the uproar over #OscarsSoWhite and the movement spearheaded by April Reign.
   
      In 2020, the Academy put in place a rule that movies must meet certain criteria in terms of representation in order to be eligible for the Academy Award for best picture beginning in 2024.
   
      CNN has reached out to both representatives for Prince-Bythewood and the Academy for comment.

      Credit Suisse
            
                (CS) has reported its biggest annual loss since the financial crisis in 2008, highlighting the scale of the challenge facing the scandal-plagued Swiss bank as it attempts a turnaround.
   
      The lender on Thursday posted a loss of 1.4 billion Swiss francs ($1.5 billion) in the fourth quarter of 2022, extending a losing streak that started in 2021 and taking its full-year loss to 7.3 billion Swiss francs ($7.9 billion). In 2008, Credit Suisse made a loss of 8.2 billion Swiss francs ($8.9 billion).
   
      The bank’s shares fell 5% in early trade. The stock has plunged 65% over the past 12 months but is up 12% so far in 2023.
   
      Credit Suisse said in a statement that the fourth-quarter performance was impacted by “the challenging economic and market environment, significant deposit and net asset outflows at the beginning of the quarter and the execution of our strategic actions.” It added that it expected to make another “substantial loss” in 2023.
   
      Customers withdrew 111 billion Swiss francs ($121 billion) in the final three months of 2022, when the bank was hit by social media speculation that it was on the brink of collapse.  
   
      The rumors, which sparked a selloff in the shares, followed a series of missteps and compliance failures that have cost the bank dearly. 
   
      For example, the collapse of US hedge fund Archegos Capital Management, a client of Credit Suisse, in 2021 cost the bank $5.5 billion. An independent external investigation later found “a failure to effectively manage risk.”
   
      Credit Suisse has since embarked on a major restructuring plan that entails cutting 9,000 full-time jobs, spinning off its investment bank and focusing on wealth management. 
   
      In a step towards this, the company announced Thursday the acquisition of M. Klein & Company, an investment banking business. 
   
      Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Körner said the deal “marks another milestone in the carve-out of CS First Boston as a leading independent capital markets and advisory business.”
   
      The bank also announced that it had finalized the first stage of the deal to sell its securitized products group to Apollo Global Management, which is expected to conclude in the first half of this year. 
   
      “We have a clear plan to create a new Credit Suisse and intend to continue to deliver on our three-year strategic transformation by reshaping our portfolio, reallocating capital, right-sizing our cost base, and building on our leading franchises.” Körner said in the statement.

      At an emergency meeting Thursday, the Florida High School Athletic Association approved a proposal to remove all questions about menstrual cycles from medical forms required to participate in high school sports in the state. 
   
      The new form will go into effect for the 2023-2024 school year and will be available starting this spring. Currently, all questions on the form about menstruation are optional. 
   
      The emergency meeting was held after the FHSAA faced months of criticism for a proposed change in policy that would require athletes to report their menstruation history every year.
   
      Under the new proposal approved Thursday, all questions about menstruation will be removed from the student forms. Such information may be kept private between a student, doctor and parents.
   
      “The intent of this proposal is to provide an updated … form which protects a student-athletes’s privacy while including pertinent medical information a health care provider at a member school would need access to,” the agenda item says.
   
      The meeting came after more than two dozen Florida lawmakers protested the proposed requirements in a letter to the FHSAA earlier this week. 
   
      “The rights of all girls in sports, including their right to privacy, must be respected as afforded in the State of Florida’s Constitution,” the legislators wrote.
   
      The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that menstruation data be collected to help medical providers evaluate students. The information would be part of “standard elements important to consider in evaluating the patient’s eligibility to participate in sports,” the group said. 
   
      The AAP form has four suggested questions about menstruation as part of the physical evaluation, including “When was your most recent menstrual period?” and “How many periods have you had in the past 12 months?”  
   
      Information on menstruation may be necessary for a medical evaluation because an irregular menstrual cycle can be a sign of pregnancy, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says. Irregular cycles can also be a sign of lower estrogen levels that may contribute to bone loss, the organization says.    
   
      But the AAP says the full medical data should not be shared with schools or sports organizations. 
   
      More than 40 states require or request data about menstrual cycles from high school athletes, according to Outsports, the LGBTQ athletic website that conducted a “state-by-state examination of publicly available ‘preparticipation physical evaluation’ forms” to compile the data.
   
      But the debate over privacy has become more pointed since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and concerns rose that states could potentially use the information on menstrual cycles to prosecute women who seek or have abortions. 
   
      Florida has a 15-week abortion ban that does not allow exemptions for rape, incest or human trafficking. It also has laws restricting transgender athletes’ participation in high school and college athletics.

      The anchors of late-night TV remain in place with Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel, the last having recently signed a contract extension that will keep him behind the desk into 2026. Bill Maher and John Oliver also remain at HBO, albeit in weekly form.
   
      But the offshoots and lead-out shows that populated (and some would say overpopulated) the genre, what might be called “later-night TV,” have been gradually swept from the playing field, casualties that serve as evidence of the decline of linear TV in the watch-when-you-want streaming age.
   
      Reports that CBS will replace James Corden’s “Late Late Show” with a revival of the game show “@midnight” follow the exits of Trevor Noah, Desus and Mero, Samantha Bee and Conan O’Brien. “Later,” the NBC show that followed Seth Meyers, is also gone, after giving way to another title that featured a woman of color, “A Little Late With Lilly Singh.”
   
      Those situations unfolded for various reasons, and the loss of opportunities for diverse talent has been an unfortunate side effect of this collective thinning of the herd. Still, the overarching dynamic is a retrenchment by TV networks, reflecting a late-night landscape that can no longer economically support the explosion of shows that came about as everyone seemingly wanted a sliver of that pie.
   
      Nor has daytime TV been immune, with what might be called the children of Oprah, Drs. Phil and Oz, giving up their shows (the latter to pursue a failed Senate bid), following Ellen DeGeneres’ decision to hang up her dancing shoes.
   
      Even the three highest-profile hosts occupy a different world from the one that they inherited from Jay Leno and David Letterman, who in turn carried on the mantle from the comic forever associated with late-night stardom, Johnny Carson.
   
      As Noah made clear when he announced his departure from “The Daily Show,” hosting a late-night series every night no longer represented the Holy Grail of comedy, at least for him, that it was in Carson’s heyday. That decision, wrote NPR critic Eric Deggans, “could send the most dire signals yet about the future of late-night TV.”
   
      In reporting on CBS’ plans, Deadline noted that a driving factor is, not surprisingly, money, and the desire to fill the hour after Colbert with a less-expensive program.
   
      The irony is that while late-night hosts have more ways to get their material out and voices heard, with viral clips disseminated via YouTube and social media, actually generating revenue off that content has become more challenging.
   
      The proliferation of late-night shows was the product of a different time in the TV industry, when a percentage of the audience – mostly younger and male – could be coaxed to stay up a little later to sample other talent, especially those considered edgy, unique and more experimental, as Letterman and then O’Brien were during their later-night years.
   
      The latest departures don’t indicate that the lights are being completely turned off just yet. But like so much in terms of the way people once consumed TV, they’re dimming. As for what the late-night market will look like by the time Kimmel’s new contract expires, that’s a crystal ball into which even Carson’s Carnac the Magnificent couldn’t clearly see.

      Some classics never go out of style, especially when it comes to John Travolta and “Grease.”
   
      The actor and singer appears in a new Super Bowl ad for T-Mobile, which dropped Thursday, in which he performs a new rendition of hit song “Summer Nights,” alongside Zach Braff and Donald Faison of “Scrubs” fame. 
   
      The track was immortalized by Travolta and his late costar Olivia Newton-John in the beloved 1978 musical film “Grease,” the movie for which the pair are most known.
   
      In the new spot, the lyrics are changed to plug the wireless service provider.
   
      The ad comes roughly six months after Newton-John’s death at the age of 73 in August 2022.
   
      Upon learning of her passing at the time, Travolta wrote a message to his late costar on Instagram, saying, “you made all of our lives so much better. Your impact was incredible.”
   
      He signed the message, “Your Danny, your John!”
   
      Danny is a nod to his character Danny Zuko in “Grease,” the love interest of Newton-John’s Sandy Olsson.
   
      In 2019, the pair spent one night recreating their iconic “Grease” personas, when they attended a sing-along of the movie and a Q&A session at the Coral Sky Amphitheatre in West Palm Beach, Florida.
   
      It was the first time the two actors had been in costume as Danny and Sandy since they first made the hit movie over 40 years ago, Newton-John wrote on her Instagram at the time.

      Barely through January, America has this year already experienced 63 incidents with four or more people shot and more than 4,200 firearm deaths.
   
      These statistics do not come from official governmental sources, but are rather the result of information compiled and disseminated publicly by a small non-profit organization, the Gun Violence Archive, funded primarily by a single private donor. Our government collects no official data on mass shootings – and has no comprehensive data collection system tracking nonfatal firearm injuries – despite intense public concern about these events and the direction they may be trending.
   
      The federal government does collect data on firearm deaths, although complete nationwide data that link whether individual deaths occurred in the same incident is not yet available. And finalized data is always a year or so delayed. By comparison, federal data on poultry slaughter across the country lags by only a couple of weeks. 
   
      What’s more, federal data collection on other aspects of gun crime and violence is abysmal. 
   
      This seems like a pretty fundamental statistic we should know, or at least have some decent estimate of. Measuring only firearm deaths and not all injuries may underestimate the prevalence of firearm violence by a factor of two to three, showing only a skewed subset of firearm violence. Because firearm assaults and police shootings often result in nonfatal injuries, federal data systems track only a portion of these incidents that disproportionately affect Black Americans.
   
      Building a surveillance system for nonfatal firearm injuries would be difficult and expensive. In 1994, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded efforts to support such a system in seven states, but the project ended after just three years when Congress cut the CDC’s budget in response to its firearm violence research. It took more than two decades for Congress to approve federal funding to research gun violence.
   
      Now, a previously unreliable nonfatal firearm injury surveillance system is being redesigned with the goal of producing moderately precise national estimates of firearms injury hospitalizations by 2024. That’s a start, but what really may be needed is reliable state-level estimates to understand how laws and other prevention efforts affect firearm violence. 
   
      The Firearm Injury Surveillance Through Emergency Rooms (FASTER) program, a 10-state pilot project launched by the CDC in September 2020, will test whether the National Syndromic Surveillance Program, which helps track urgent crises like the Covid-19 pandemic and opioid overdoses, can be used to monitor firearm injuries. 
   
      The federal government could make important contributions to firearm injury prevention efforts by ensuring that funding for data collection and maintenance through FASTER or another system is sustained moving forward and creating straightforward mechanisms for researchers to access deidentified individual-level data with geographic indicators.
   
      Unfortunately, data quality on other aspects of gun violence is deteriorating. For decades, the FBI has compiled and disseminated information from local law enforcement agencies on aggravated assaults and robberies involving firearms. This system was retired in 2021. As a result, the federal government has been unable to provide comprehensive state or national estimates on important crime trends for the past two years.  
   
      While a more detailed (and theoretically improved) system replaced the prior one, the rollout of this FBI System has not gone smoothly. In 2021, the FBI’s new data system collected crime information from just over 60% of law enforcement agencies nationwide, resulting in uncertainty about whether murder in 2021 was up 17% or down 7% from the year before.
   
      This crumbling of the nation’s crime data infrastructure, even if temporary, could be an urgent problem for any effort to proactively intervene to respond to emerging crime trends. 
   
      Although the Federal government uses large-scale surveys of Americans to understand trends in health and risk behaviors – such as consumption of drugs and alcohol, use of seatbelts, exercise habits, and even sexual practices – questions about ownership, storage, and use of firearms have been notably absent from national versions of these surveys for almost two decades. 
   
      Indeed, one of the CDC’s flagship health behavior surveys included questions on gun ownership, but removed that question from the core module after 2004. As a result, many studies of the effects of gun violence prevention that need information on state firearm ownership rates must use data that are almost 20 years old. 
   
      Similarly, although the government’s 50-state National Survey on Drug Use and Health asks respondents aged 12 to 17 about handgun carrying behavior, no such questions are asked of adults, despite evidence linking gun carriage policies with firearm violence. 
   
      Other important questions also are omitted from these surveys, such as defensive gun use, firearm storage practices, safe handling practices and training and safety perceptions. 
   
      The lowest hanging fruit to improve our data collection could be to remove statutory barriers that prevent researchers from using important data that the federal government is already collecting, such as information on guns used in crimes. Since 2003, the Tiahrt Amendments have prohibited the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from sharing disaggregated crime gun trace data with researchers. 
   
      Removing these blanket restrictions, or even providing more detailed aggregate statistics on crime gun possessors, sources and prior transactions, could help provide better understanding of diversion of firearms from legal to illegal markets, risk factors related to “straw-purchasing” (buying a gun for somebody legally prohibited from possessing it), and the flow of firearms between states with different gun law regimes.
   
      Other missing data from federal collection efforts include reliable information on police shootings, mass shootings, legal defensive firearm homicides, firearm sales and many other such data. 
   
      Although everyone wants to see reductions in firearm violence in this country, specific proposals are often controversial, sometimes because there are no data demonstrating their effectiveness. If those data were collected, this would no longer be an excuse. Better evidence on the effectiveness of different policy or community interventions may rely on access to data that is not being collected now. 
   
      The federal government has many of the requisite tools in place to do this, and it does it well on a wide range of other problems. Shying away from measuring this problem may also make it more difficult to fix it.

      Zach Roloff’s wife Tori has shared about the reality star undergoing emergency surgery.
   
      The pair star on TLC’s “Little People, Big World.” On Thursday, she posted some photos of Roloff in the hospital on her verified Instagram account.
 
      “Not exactly how we saw our week going…,” the caption read. “Zachary had emergency shunt revision this morning. It’s been a scary 72 hours but he is doing well and recovering!!”
   
According to Johns Hopkins Medicine’s site, “A shunt is a hollow tube surgically placed in the brain (or occasionally in the spine) to help drain cerebrospinal fluid and redirect it to another location in the body where it can be reabsorbed.” 
   
      She thanked friends, family and followers for their prayers and support.
   
      Tori Roloff also shared praise for her husband.
   
      “I’m here praying that Zach’s recovery is quick and easy and that this will be our answered prayers to relieving his migraines!” she wrote. “You’re a freaking bad a**, Zach. You just had brain surgery… and handled it like a rockstar. I’m so proud of you.”
   
      Zach Roloff has a form of dwarfism as do his parents, Matt and Amy, and their lives along with that of Zach’s siblings, Jeremy, Molly and Jacob spurred the reality series that premiered in 2006.

      Burt Bacharach has one of the most impressive songbooks in the history of the music industry.
   
      And while he is incredibly well known for hits like “Walk on By” by Dionne Warwick and “I Say A Little Prayer,” which was first recorded by Warwick and then covered by Aretha Franklin (both songs he co-wrote with Hal David), there are a few other songs that may not be as well known. 
   
      Here are just a few of the tunes that helped to make Bacharach one of the most accomplished songwriters of our time.
   
      This song which tells the tale of a couple post a heartbreaking split, was a smash after it was released in 1986.
   
      The music video was peak ’80s, featuring LaBelle with big hair, a big fur coat and her even bigger voice. McDonald’s distinctive, souldful voice which helped shoot his group The Doobie Brothers to success.
   
      Bacharach co-wrote the song with his former wife, Carole Bayer Sager.
   
      Released in 1962 when divorce was not as common as it is now, the song, which Bacharach co-wrote with Bob Hilliard, ended up being a B-side single.
   
      While it may not be one of his most famous songs, it was consequential in that it was during the recording session he met a young backup singer named Dionne Warwick.
   
      This one is both critically acclaimed and beloved. It won a Grammy in 1999 for Costello and Bacharach for best pop collaboration with vocals.
   
      The song was a part of the 1998 collaborative album between the two of them, titled “Painted from Memory.” It later went on to be part of the soundtrack for the 1999 film, “Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.”

Brooklyn Nets guard Cam Thomas was fined by the NBA $40,000 for using “derogatory and disparaging language” during a postgame interview following the team’s 116-105 win over the Chicago Bulls on Thursday.
   
      Thomas was interviewed by TNT on the court, alongside new teammate Spencer Dinwiddie who the team acquired in the Kyrie Irving trade earlier in the week. Thomas was asked about Dinwiddie’s comments that the Nets didn’t acquire the best players, but the “best looking” ones. 
   
      “The Nets needed help in that department,” Dinwiddie added.
   
      Thomas responded to those comments by saying, “We already had good-looking guys,” then using an anti-gay slur to end the sentence.

      A statue of the late actor Philip Seymour Hoffman will now permanently stand outside the George Eastman Museum in Rochester, New York.
   
      The life-size bronze statue was crafted by David A. Annand and commissioned by philanthropist and film producer James Declan Tobin, according to a news release from the museum, which is dedicated to photography and film.
   
      The statue originally came to the museum as part of a temporary exhibit and was meant to eventually end up in New York City. But the statue fit the space so well, the decision was made to donate the statue to the facility permanently. There are also plans for a second Hoffman statue in New York City, according to the museum.
   
      “Our board of trustees, staff, and members are thrilled that this wonderful sculpture of Philip Seymour Hoffman has been placed at our Dryden Theatre,” said Bruce Barnes, the museum’s director, in the release. “Since the museum was founded, one of our key missions has been to preserve and exhibit motion pictures, and this statue enables us to recognize Hoffman’s extraordinary contribution to the art of cinema.”
   
      The sculpture depicts Hoffman walking toward the steps of the museum’s Dryden Theatre.
   
      Hoffman, who died in 2014 at age 46, grew up in nearby Fairport, New York. In the news release, his mother Marilyn O’Connor called the sculpture “a loving memorial” to her son. The Dryden Theatre was also the venue of Hoffman’s local memorial service.
   
      “The Eastman Museum’s decision to retain the sculpture makes me very happy,” said O’Connor. “There was an enthusiastic response to having this beautiful statue of Phil at the museum. This is what the Rochester community wanted.”
   
      The George Eastman Museum is currently hosting a yearlong film series in honor of the Oscar-winning actor. A total of 24 films featuring Hoffman will screen over the course of the year.
   
      In the news release, Tobin, who commissioned the statue, said the venue was a fitting location for the statue.
   
      “The greatest actor of my generation has come home to the community that loves him,” Tobin said in the release. “This is where Phil belongs. I wanted a home that is worthy of Phil, and we have it at the Dryden Theatre, which is a classic temple of film. He is on the move, a script in his bag, walking toward the theater he so loved.”
   
      “There was a lot of silence after Phil died,” Tobin went on. “He was with us, so brilliant, so powerfully present, and then he slipped away. I wanted to keep the light going. I wanted Phil’s family to know the impact he had on me and the world.”

      More than a decade has passed since Mitt Romney lost political support during his failed 2012 presidential campaign for boasting about having “binders full of women” suitable for government appointments and writing off the “47% of Americans” who pay no federal income tax. 
   
      But his remark about Russia being America’s “number one geopolitical foe” — which was widely ridiculed at the time — now seems prescient in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s murderous invasion of Ukraine. 
   
      In the past few years, the senator from Utah has earned a reputation for being a rare, candid voice in Washington, willing to buck his party. He was the lone Republican who voted to remove President Donald Trump from office in his first impeachment trial and one of seven to do so in Trump’s second impeachment. 
   
      Minutes before the State of the Union speech Tuesday, Romney encountered the scandal-ridden Republican Rep. George Santos on the House floor and told him what many of the New York congressman’s constituents — and others around the country — are saying: “You don’t belong here.” (Santos told reporters afterward: “It wasn’t very Mormon of him.”)
   
      Even more tellingly, Romney broke with his party’s stance on China’s spy balloon. After a closed-door briefing by administration officials Thursday, Romney told reporters, “I believe that the administration, the president, our military and intelligence agencies, acted skillfully and with care,” and said he agreed with their decision to wait to shoot down the balloon until it moved over the Atlantic Ocean, off the Carolinas. 
   
      House Republicans, who were initially planning a resolution condemning the Biden administration for not bringing down the balloon sooner, switched the wording to condemn the government of China for sending the craft over US territory in the first place. 
   
      It passed 419-0, a small act of bipartisanship only two days after a group of House Republicans heckled President Joe Biden as he was addressing both houses in his annual speech. There are not a lot of Romneys — or indeed any — in the ranks of the extreme GOPers who bucked their own House Speaker’s shushing to shout their displeasure at Biden’s remarks.
   
      “Some members of the Republican caucus seemed keen to highlight the distinctions between the thoughtful, unity-emphasizing Biden and their own party’s shameful descent,” wrote Jill Filipovic. “Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, among others, repeatedly booed and yelled throughout the speech; when he introduced the parents of Tyre Nichols, who was last month fatally beaten by Memphis police officers, and the Ukrainian ambassador, she stayed seated. That perhaps says more than Biden ever could.”
   
SE Cupp called McCarthy’s “shushing” a “surprisingly gallant act of leadership from someone who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, voted to overturn the 2020 election results and packed the House Oversight Committee with election deniers.” 
   
      “Will he continue to ‘shush’ the extremist, conspiratorial and ‘Never Biden’ wing of his party — whom he has empowered and elevated — as they act out and get in the way of his agenda, which might even include working with Biden from time to time?”
   
Geoff Duncan, a Republican who formerly served as Georgia’s lieutenant governor, wrote that “neither the southern border nor inflation received much attention from the president — despite both issues being of importance to voters. Neither did the Chinese spy balloon, whose coast-to-coast journey undermines Biden’s tough talk toward Chinese President Xi Jinping.” 
   
      Biden “was feisty, full of energy, marshaled his arguments effectively and even batted back Republican catcalls with good humor,” observed David Gergen. “By the end of the evening, he looked like a boxer who can’t wait to get into the ring again.”
   
      “But he now faces an even sterner test: Did he actually move the needle? Among presidents of the recent past, a public appearance as powerful as this one could shake up politics. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan each had the capacity to change minds when they held a microphone.” 
   
      The president’s “discussion of ‘the talk’ that Black parents give to their children about how to safely interact with police officers was the most moving part of his speech,” wrote former Rep. Mondaire Jones, a Democrat. 
   
      “Still, it was political malpractice for him not to explicitly call for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The family of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was fatally beaten by Memphis police officers last month, deserved to hear it.”
   
Raul Reyes noted that “Biden smartly aligned himself with populist issues, like making wealthy corporations pay their fair share of taxes and proposing that all federal infrastructure projects use American-made materials.”  
   
      The 80-year-old president’s vision was decidedly blue-collar — and 20th century — in its aim to rebuild America’s manufacturing base and reduce the reliance on trade with the rest of the world. 
   
      But, as Julian Zelizer pointed out, “times have changed and Biden has a tough road ahead. While the president offered a robust vision of how federal investment has and could create jobs in key sectors such as the semi-conductor industry and infrastructure, the kinds of manufacturing jobs that were at the heart of federal investment between the 1930s and 1960s have vastly diminished and are not likely to return.” 
   
      “Biden needs to acknowledge how his economic populism will address the industries of the 2020s rather than those of the 1950s and 1960s.” 
   
      Biden’s success in 2020 owed a lot to the contrast with the chaos and extremism of the Trump administration, Bill McGowan and Juliana Silva wrote. The outbursts by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and her colleagues allow Biden to surf the same wave now. “By keeping the hostility factor high, the GOP is also paving the way for Biden to reuse in 2024 one of his stickiest and most effective campaign messages from 2020: that the election is nothing short of a battle for the ‘soul of the nation.’ Thanks to the new breed of attention-seeking, far-right Republicans, Biden gets to go back to that well regardless of whether Trump is his opponent or not.” 
   
      The president turned the heckling to his advantage by getting Republicans to deny any intention of cutting Social Security or Medicare. “You can say Mr. Biden fibbed, misled and exaggerated, and you wouldn’t be wrong,” Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal, “but in rope-a-doping Republicans on Medicare and Social Security he showed real mastery.” 
 
      In “a scathing rebuke” to Biden’s speech that served as the GOP’s official reply, “Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it’s time for a new generation of Republican leadership,” Alice Stewart noted.
   
      “At 40, Sanders is the youngest governor in the country. She spoke of Biden as the oldest president in American history, and at 80-years-old, she said, he is simply ‘unfit to serve as commander in chief.’”
   
      Left unsaid was that Trump, Sanders’ former boss, would be 78 by Election Day, 2024 — and he is running for the presidency again.
   
Patrick T. Brown spoke for a lot of Americans when he pleaded for something other than a Biden-Trump rematch: “A 2024 presidential election that features another slugfest between two elderly leaders rather than a scrappy fight between up-and-coming politicians with energy and enthusiasm would be doing the nation a disservice.”
   
      “New polling suggests a growing desire for new faces. 58% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters told a Washington Post/ABC News poll they hoped their party nominates someone other than Biden in 2024. According to the poll, 49% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said the same thing about former President Donald Trump.”

      Dr. Abdurrahman Alomar and his family were jolted awake at 4:17 am Monday in their sixth-floor apartment in Gaziantep, Turkey. A devastating earthquake had struck and they hurried out of the building in their pajamas into snow-filled streets. Taking refuge in their car, away from any buildings, Alomar spoke to CNN Opinion’s Sheena McKenzie about the toll the quake is taking on a region already devastated by war. 
   
      Alomar is a pediatrician who works as a senior health adviser with the Syrian American Medical Society, providing medical assistance across the border. “In northwest Syria, we are already suffering from a shortage of supplies, and we are now using the regular inventories in our warehouses,” Alomar said.
   
      “So we are in urgent need of additional support to compensate these supplies for regular operations — and also to be ready for aftershocks and more casualties who may come to our hospitals.” 
   
      In the New York Times, Turkish author and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk wrote, “Aid has been dispatched, but the trucks loaded with supplies are stuck for hours on jammed roads hundreds of miles from the affected areas. People who have lost their homes, their families, their loved ones, everything they ever had find that there is nobody doing anything about the fires beginning to break out in their cities. And so they block the path of any official vehicle, policeman or government employee they can find and start to remonstrate. I have never seen our people so angry.”
   
      As of Sunday, the death toll in the quake stood at more than 28,000, with tens of thousands injured.
   
      A year ago, shortly before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, former comedian-turned-president “Volodymyr Zelensky’s popularity ratings were tanking as he battled allegations of unmet campaign promises to tackle endemic corruption,” recalled Michael Bociurkiw. 
   
      “Then on February 24, Russia’s total invasion blasted these concerns into the background. Almost overnight, that dark cloud over Zelensky vanished as he defied critics, and miraculously pivoted into the role of heroic wartime president and global symbol of defender of the free world.”
   
      “His popularity ratings surged — and have stayed high ever since — currently hovering at around 84%.”
   
      But corruption is still pervasive in Ukraine, as recent allegations and a new crackdown have shown, and Bociurkiw argued that it’s vital to keep fighting it.
   
      “Zelensky needs to respond to allegations of wrongdoing with the same determination that Ukrainian servicemen have demonstrated on the battlefield.”
   
      “This is an opportunity to create a nation where corruption is not tolerated, and where oligarchs no longer have a free hand to rape and pillage the economy.”

      What would China have done if a US balloon entered its airspace, intelligence analyst Beth Sanner asked. 
   
      China would have shot it down “without hesitation, regardless of any risk to Chinese citizens or property.”
   
      “So China’s protestations about the outrageousness of the US shootdown of a spy balloon flying over our sovereign territory seem a little rich, to put it mildly,” Sanner wrote.  
   
      “I understand why Americans were alarmed by the balloon,” she added, “but there are much bigger threats posed by China. We should address the shortcomings this incident exposed — including what appears to be gaps in our air defense and detection systems that would have allowed us to shoot such a balloon down before it ever reached US landfall — but political one-upmanship on such a fraught and grave matter as relations with China is dangerous.” 
   
      Napoleon’s soldiers used balloons for surveillance in 1794, as did Union soldiers during the US Civil War. Peter Bergen’s father worked on a US Air Force program that sent balloons over the Soviet Union in the 1950s, Bergen wrote. 
   
      But there’s newer technology in the form of satellites that can take video, use thermal imagery to detect people moving around at night and “spy on pretty much anything, with a resolution of centimeters,” Bergen noted. 
   
      “In other words, the overflight of US territory by China’s balloon is not a national security catastrophe as a bunch of hyperventilating Republican politicians from former President Donald Trump on downward have implied,” Bergen added.

      Chocolate ice cream for breakfast, a hot dog with mustard and relish for lunch: Those are the reported meal selections of the 82-year-old former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
   
      Lots of other lifestyle choices, plus genetics, may enable people to do just fine with such a diet. But CNN Opinion’s Kirsi Goldynia wrote, “As endearing as it is to imagine a politician scarfing down a frank with all the fixings or a bowl of chocolate ice cream, new research is exposing the health impacts of diets like Pelosi’s, high in ultraprocessed foods.”
   
      “Pelosi isn’t an outlier. In the US, a whopping 58% of adults’ daily calories, and 67% of kids’ daily calories, come from ultraprocessed foods, according to cancer epidemiologist Fang Fang Zhang.” A raft of recent studies has demonstrated that consuming ultraprocessed foods increases the risk of cancer and cognitive decline as people age. 
   
      Goldynia interviewed Marion Nestle, a nutrition expert and retired professor at New York University. “Studies show that ultraprocessed foods encourage people to eat more calories,” Nestle said, “and the subjects gain weight as a result. So, if you want to do something about obesity, and you want to lose weight, one way to do that would be to eat fewer ultraprocessed foods… If you’re somebody who can’t resist this stuff if you have it in the house, don’t buy it.”

      A year after celebrities were paid lavishly to endorse cryptocurrencies in Super Bowl ads, the mood is different. “Crypto winter” set in, and one of the leading companies in the field, FTX, collapsed spectacularly. 
   
Kara Alaimo wrote, “So far this year, brands seem to not be sticking their necks out. In a Doritos ad, paparazzi bombard rapper Jack Harlow with questions about a love triangle. Budweiser’s spot is based on the theory that we’re all connected by six degrees of separation. Serena Williams takes up golf in an ad for Michelob Ultra…”
   
      “One ad that may buck the trend of brands playing it safe this Super Bowl is M&M’S. The company recently claimed to be putting its spokescandies on ‘pause’ after they got caught up in the culture wars. After the green M&M started wearing sneakers instead of heeled boots last year, the company received a wave of criticism. … The brand would be smart to stay woke. The actress Maya Rudolph will appear in a commercial during the game. Hopefully the ad sends a message about the value of diversity and inclusiveness.” 
   
      Tom Brady won’t be on the field, following a losing season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and his recent re-retirement announcement. Still, as Gene Seymour wrote, Brady “has been so habitually labeled the greatest quarterback, and — remarkably, by some — as the greatest football player period (!), that the GOAT acronym has, to all intents and purposes, become virtually synonymous with his name.”
   
      On Tuesday, LeBron James broke the career scoring record in the NBA, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. “The GOAT chants are building to a fervent pitch around James’s name against those who believe Michael Jordan closed off the GOAT discussion in professional basketball with his six titles with the Chicago Bulls.”
   
      All of the GOAT-talk leaves Seymour cold. 
   
      “I don’t begrudge those filling hours at a barber shop or a corner bar arguing about who is or isn’t a GOAT. I’m just asking to leave me out of it. I’m now content to say there are performers in many arenas I feel closest to in spirit because of how they do their work, play their games, sing their songs. They’re likely not all-time greats and have been superseded by newer, younger talent. But they’re great enough for me.”

      Basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan is making a record-breaking $10 million donation to Make-A-Wish America in honor of his upcoming 60th birthday, the organization announced Wednesday.
   
      The gift is the largest given by an individual in the foundation’s 43-year history. 
   
      Jordan, who turns 60 on Friday, hopes his donation will inspire others to support Make-A-Wish. 
   
      “For the past 34 years, it’s been an honor to partner with Make-A-Wish and help bring a smile and happiness to so many kids,” the Charlotte Hornets owner said in a statement. 
   
      “Witnessing their strength and resilience during such a tough time in their lives has truly been an inspiration. I can’t think of a better birthday gift than seeing others join me in supporting Make-A-Wish so that every child can experience the magic of having their wish come true.”
   
      The first wish Jordan granted happened in 1989. He has “granted hundreds of wishes to children all over the world,” according to the organization.  
   
      Jordan was named a Make-A-Wish ambassador “for the life-changing impact he has had on wish kids and their families” in 2008.
   
      “Michael using his birthday as a chance to make history for Make-A-Wish speaks to the quality of his character and his loyal dedication to making life better for children with critical illnesses,” said Leslie Motter, president and CEO of Make-A-Wish America. 
   
      “We hope that the public will be inspired to follow in his footsteps by helping make wishes come true.”  
   
      Jordan played 15 seasons in the NBA, won five MVP awards and won six titles before retiring for a final time in 2003.
   
      He has enjoyed lucrative endorsement deals with Nike, Hanes, Gatorade and Upper Deck, among others, and has donated millions to social and charitable causes over the years.

At a store next door, 23 people were killed in another mass shooting in 2019","One person was killed and three others were injured in a shooting Wednesday evening at a mall in El Paso, Texas, police said, sending patrons running or sheltering in a community scarred three years ago by a shooting massacre in a store just down the road.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/us/el-paso-texas-mall-shooting-thursday/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230215190133-04-el-paso-mall-shots-fired.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-02-16T09:07:52Z,"
      One person was killed and three others were injured in a shooting Wednesday evening at a mall in El Paso, Texas, police said, sending patrons running or sheltering in a community scarred three years ago by a shooting massacre in a store just down the road. 
   
      Two random groups had a physical altercation that led to a gun being drawn in the food court of the Cielo Vista Mall, interim El Paso Police Chief Peter Pacillas said Thursday. The cause of the altercation has not been released.  
   
      One person is dead and three others injured after a shooting Wednesday evening at the Cielo Vista Mall in El Paso, Texas, according to police.
   
      Police Sgt. Robert Gomez described the scene Wednesday as “chaotic.” “People did flee. They were scared,” he said.
   
      Surveillance video from a bar inside the mall captured more than a dozen people sprinting away from the sound of gunshots and, later, paramedics wheeling in a stretcher.  
   
      The identities of the deceased and injured have not been released, but the ages of those involved range from late teens to early twenties, according to Pacillas.
   
      All four people shot were male, Pacillas said. Two of the injured were brought to the University Medical Center of El Paso in critical condition, the hospital told CNN. The third injured person was also hospitalized, Gomez said, but their condition is unknown.
   
      The shooting does not appear to be gang related, according to Pacillas.  
   
      The mall is immediately adjacent to a Walmart where a shooting in 2019 killed 23 and left nearly two dozen more injured. The 24-year-old gunman pleaded guilty to 90 federal charges last week as part of a plea deal.
   
      The Wednesday shooting is yet another example of gunfire shattering the sense of security many Americans once felt in public spaces, like shopping centers, grocery stores and schools. 
   
      So far this year, there have been more than 70 mass shootings across the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Both CNN and the archive define a “mass shooting” as a shooting that injured or killed four or more people, not including the shooter. 
   
      Robert Gonzalez was at the mall Wednesday and during the 2019 shooting, he told CNN. He saw people “running to the exit” Wednesday, he said, and video he took inside the mall shows several storefronts had their security gates down. Outside, a second video shows police gathered at the entrance. 
   
      “I was working (at the mall) the last time this happened with the Walmart shooting so it just brought back bad memories,” Gonzalez said.
   
      Investigators preliminarily believe the shooting occurred around the food court in the upper level of the mall, Gomez said. 
   
      Marie Hall had just clocked in for her shift at a salad shop in the food court when she heard gunshots ring out, she told CNN affiliate KFOX. She ran to the back of the restaurant and hid in a walk-in fridge with another employee and two customers, she said. 
   
      “Nothing prepares you for that,” she told the affiliate. “I didn’t really feel safe (going to work) in the beginning because of the shooting in 2019. … It is definitely going to be more difficult to be going in to work.”
   
      An off-duty police officer who was working security in one of the mall’s stores was able to respond to the scene within three minutes and take a person into custody, Pacillas said. He did not say when, where or how the second person was apprehended. 
   
      Multiple law enforcement agencies, including El Paso police, the Texas Department of Public Safety and US Border Patrol, responded to the scene and worked into the night to clear the building and begin a preliminary investigation, police said. 
   
      The FBI, which is assisting with the investigation, has created a website for people to submit photos and video of the incident.
   
      Even some community members who were not present during Wednesday’s shooting feel the event has reopened old wounds. 
   
      Albert Hernandez, whose sister Maribel and brother-in-law Leo Campos were killed in the 2019 shooting, told KFOX he feels political leaders are “not accepting the full scope of the situation” of gun violence and are “numb to what’s going on.”
   
      “We felt the same feelings come back to us as the day of the Walmart shooting. Everything comes back and we’re just wondering, now what? How many people are going to get hurt?” Hernandez said.

      Rebel Wilson wants to help people find the “kind of love with no labels.”
   
      The “Pitch Perfect” star talked to People magazine about launching her new dating app, “Fluid.”
   
      Wilson, who is in a relationship with Ramona Agruma, told the publication, “This is the first dating app where you don’t have to actually define yourself or tick a box to say ‘I’m straight, I’m gay, I’m bisexual,’ and you don’t have to describe what you are looking for.”
   
      “What’s really cool is, it’s open to everyone,” she said. “You might just be interested in checking out a wider dating pool like I was. It covers a lot of the LGBTQIA+ spectrum, but I think even if you’re straight you could use the app and have an amazing time.”
   
      Wilson is one of the co-founders of the app. She surprised many when she revealed in June 2022 that she was dating Agruma, who is a fashion and jewelry designer. 
 
      The star now says she wishes the app was around years ago, explaining she “never thought” that she was “was 100 percent straight.” 
   
      “Something like this would have really helped me and maybe I would have stumbled upon a female’s profile and been like, ‘OK, maybe I do want to message them.’” Wilson said. “I totally would have joined up for Fluid because you don’t have to label yourself in any way. You just see who you connect with. I know that, to me, it doesn’t matter about the gender, it just matters about the person.”
   
      The app is scheduled to be available for download later this month.

      New Mexico State University has fired men’s basketball head coach Greg Heiar amid allegations of hazing within the team, the university’s chancellor announced Tuesday – days after the school ended the team’s season over the accusations.
   
      “As I’ve stated previously, hazing has no place on our campus, and those found responsible will be held accountable for their actions,” chancellor Dan E. Arvizu said in an open letter to the university community. He did not provide specific details on why Heiar was fired.
   
      CNN is attempting to reach Heiar, who was in his first year as the team’s coach and finishes the tenure with a 9-15 record, for comment.
   
      Heiar and the team’s coaching staff were placed on paid administrative leave and the program was suspended indefinitely as the university investigates the allegations, the school said Saturday. The school said Sunday the suspension would last at least through this season.
   
      “Any further decisions regarding the remainder of the coaching staff will be made after additional investigations are concluded,” Arvizu said Tuesday.
   
      Though university officials did not provide details on the allegations, a member of the men’s basketball team told school police last week that he has been subjected to “ongoing ‘hazing’ … while in the men’s basketball locker room” since the summer, according to a New Mexico State University Police Department case report obtained by CNN affiliate KVIA and shared with CNN.
   
      The player said this to police Friday, the report reads – a day before the school announced the team’s suspension. 
   
      The most recent incident, the player told police, was on February 6 when three of his teammates held him down in the locker room, “removed his clothing exposing his buttocks and began to ‘slap his a**,’ ” the report reads. The report redacts all four players’ names, ages and dates of birth.
   
      The player said his teammates “also touched his scrotum,” according to the report.  
   
      This type of conduct also happened in locker rooms at away games, the player told police, explaining “he had no choice but to let this happen because its a ‘3 on 1’ type of situation,” according to the report.  
   
      Usually, the whole team would witness the conduct but no one would intervene, the report reads, citing the player. He also said another player may have been subjected to similar mistreatment, according to the report.  
   
      No arrests have been announced. The player told police Friday he did not want to pursue criminal charges at that time, the report reads.
   
      In a Saturday letter announcing the team’s suspension, Arvizu said he was “heartbroken and sickened to hear about these hazing allegations.”
   
      The chancellor called hazing a “despicable act” that “humiliates and degrades someone and has the potential to cause physical and emotional harm, or even death.”
   
      “Sadly, hazing can become part of an organization’s culture, if left unchecked. NMSU policy strictly prohibits hazing, in all forms, and it’s something we simply will not tolerate,” Arvizu’s Saturday letter reads.
   
      CNN has sought comment from the university and New Mexico police regarding the allegations. 
   
      The Aggies had already weathered controversy this season. In November, player Mike Peake was wounded in a fatal shooting on a rival team’s campus.
   
      New Mexico State Police allege Brandon Travis, a University of New Mexico student, conspired with three fellow students to lure Peake to their campus and assault him. After Travis shot Peake, who was also armed, Peake fatally shot Travis, police said.
   
      A basketball game between the two schools scheduled that night was canceled following the shooting. Peake has not been charged in the incident.

      Tesla CEO Elon Musk gave 11.5 million shares of his stake in the electric automaker to an undisclosed charity last year, shares worth about $1.9 billion at the time they were donated.
   
      The donation would make him the second largest charitable donor in 2022, according to a ranking of the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which was compiled before Musk’s filing. The Chronicle’s ranking lists Bill Gates as No. 1 with $5.1 billion in donations, followed by Michael Bloomberg at $1.7 billion. 
   
      Musk’s net worth at the end of 2022 stood at $137 billion, according to Forbes’ real time billionaire tracker, so the $1.9 billion represented about 1.4% of his net worth at that time.
   
      Musk’s 2022 donations are down from the estimated value of his donations reported for 2021, when he reported that he had given 5 million Tesla
            
                (TSLA) shares, then worth an estimated $5.7 billion, at the end of that year. A three-for-one stock split in Tesla
            
                (TSLA) shares in August of last year means the number of shares he donated in 2021 was also 30% greater than his 2022 donations, on a split-adjusted basis.
   
      Musk’s donations in 2021 also were to an undisclosed charity. They came at a time that he had been challenged by David Beasley, the UN food program director, to donate $6 billion to battle global hunger. Beasley had said a donation of that size could feed more than 40 million people across 43 countries that are “on the brink of famine.” Musk responded on Twitter at that time if the World Food Program “can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.”
   
      Musk’s 2021 donation of Tesla shares came soon after that exchange, but there was never any confirmation as to where the shares went to.
   
      The most recent donation of shares represented 1.6% of Musk’s stake in the company at the end of last year when considering both shares he held outright and the vested options he holds to purchase additional shares. 
   
      Since the end of the year he had another 25.3 million options vest when the company achieved certain financial goals, a grant the company had already said was probable to take place. So Musk made the donation knowing that he would soon receive options to buy twice a many shares at a nominal price.
   
      Musk did sell a far larger portion of his Tesla stake in the last 18 months than he has donated. First he sold $16.4 billion worth of Tesla stock in 2021, with most going to to pay a large income tax bill he faced for exercising options in 2021 before they expired. Then in 2022 he sold $22.9 billion worth of Tesla shares as he raised cash for his purchase of Twitter.
   
      Tesla shares had their worst year on record in 2022, losing 65% of their value. The drop in share price knocked him out of position as the world’s richest person. But after a rough start to this year, they’ve rebounded nicely in 2023, rising 70% year-to-date. Given Tuesday’s closing price, the 11.5 million shares that Musk donated last year are worth $2.4 billion.
   
      Musk is now the second richest person on the planet, behind Bernard Arnault, the chairman of French luxury goods giant LVMH, according to an estimate by Forbes’ real time billionaire tracker, with a net worth of about $196.5 billion. 
   
      The typical US household has a net worth of about $121,700, according to the most recent estimate from the Federal Reserve. So the $2.4 billion current value of Musk’s donations last year, compared to his current net worth, is the equivalent of that typical family donating $1,500, or just less than $30 a week.

      Hyundai and Kia are offering a new free software patch to owners of 8.3 million vehicles that are so easy to steal that some insurance companies refuse to offer coverage for them in certain markets.
   
      The vehicles in question, 2015-2019 Hyundai and Kia models with turn-key ignitions — as opposed to push-button start — are roughly twice as likely to be stolen as other vehicles of a similar age. The reason: Many of these vehicles lack some of the basic auto theft prevention technology included in most other vehicles, even in those years, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute.
   
      The models in question don’t have electronic immobilizers, which rely on a computer chip in the car and another in the key that communicate to confirm that the key belongs with that vehicle. Without the right key, an immobilizer should do just that — stop the car from moving.
   
      These models became the subject of a social media trend in which thieves filmed themselves and others stealing Hyundai and Kia vehicles and took them on joyrides. Thefts of these vehicles resulted in at least 14 crashes and eight deaths, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
   
      The two South Korean automakers have come up with a software patch to fix the problem, the automakers and NHTSA said Tuesday. Hyundai and Kia operate as separate companies in the United States, but Hyundai Motor Group owns a large stake in Kia, and various Hyundai and Kia models share much of their engineering.
   
      The patch will be installed free of charge on vulnerable models, with software that requires an actual key in the ignition to turn the vehicle on. (Thieves have been using the tips of USB cables to turn the ignition switch) The software will also block the car from being started after the doors have been locked using the key fob remote control. The vehicle will need to be unlocked before it can be started. The software also extends the length of the alarm sound from 30 seconds to a full minute. Hyundai dealers will also affix window stickers stating that the vehicle has anti-theft software installed.
   
      Hyundai will begin providing the software immediately for the most popular — and most frequently stolen — vulnerable models. Kia said it has started to offer the update to some customers and expects to make it available to affected vehicles “over the next few months.”

      Some Michigan State University students who survived Monday’s mass shooting – and their parents – had already been through a similar, horrific experience. 
   
      “(Fourteen) months ago I had to evacuate from Oxford High School when a fifteen year old opened fire and killed four of my classmates and injured seven more. Tonight, I am sitting under my desk at Michigan State University, once again texting everyone ‘I love you,’” Emma Riddle, a freshman studying history at the university tweeted overnight Monday. “When will this end?” 
   
      Her father, Matt Riddle, told CNN Tuesday his daughter survived the November 30, 2021, shooting at Oxford High School in a community about 80 miles northeast of the MSU campus in East Lansing.
   
      There, another gunman opened fired Monday night, killing three students and wounding five others and sending terrified students running or escaping out of windows while others barricaded themselves inside classrooms. The shooter died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said. 
   
      Emma Riddle survived the first shooting in Oxford by hiding in the band hall where others had barricaded the door before eventually fleeing to a store in the area, her father said, recalling the phone call he got as she ran away. 
   
      Less than a year and a half later, his daughter called again, Matt Riddle said – this time hiding in her dorm at Michigan State. 
   
      “She was very fearful and scared,” Matt Riddle told CNN. “And shocked. She has been through this before. I just talked to her and tried to make her feel calm.” 
   
      In the hours after the shots rang out, as hundreds of police officers converged on the school to search for the gunman, the father and daughter exchanged texts and phone calls.
   
      “Not knowing what was happening and the danger was hard,” Riddle said.
   
      Andrea Ferguson told CNN affiliate WDIV her daughter and other classmates were also survivors of both shootings. 
   
      “I never expected in my lifetime to have to experience two school shootings,” Ferguson said. “There’s several kids there that our daughter’s friends with that are going through the same thing.”
   
      CNN has reached out to Ferguson for comment. 
   
      Her daughter, Ava, a freshman, told “CNN This Morning” on Wednesday that the MSU shooting compounded her trauma from the 2021 tragedy. 
   
      “After Oxford they said that this wasn’t going to happen again, that we were going to be safe going back to school, and that’s just not the case,” Ava Ferguson said. “The other night, I was in shock. I didn’t think it was real, honestly.” 
   
      Ferguson said the latest shooting was “traumatizing all over again” and she’s “still a little like shaken up by it.” 
   
      “There should have been laws made here years ago – when Sandy Hook happened – and it never did,” she said. “And I feel like now’s the time people need to start realizing there is people dying every day because of gun violence and something needs to be done about it.” 
   
      Ava Ferguson said she is a cancer survivor and had only been on the MSU campus for a few weeks. 
 
      Her mother told WDIV that Ava was getting on a bus on another part of campus on Monday when she started receiving texts about the shooting. 
   
      “It was like reliving Oxford all over again,” said Ferguson, who had been on the phone with her daughter when the young woman received texts about the latest mass shooting. 
   
      The mother described her daughter as “unbelievably terrified” and said it was “really, really surreal” to relive such a horrific experience. 
   
      US Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat, said it was haunting to see a young person wearing an “Oxford Strong” sweatshirt in footage from MSU after Monday’s shooting. 
   
      “As a representative of Oxford, Michigan, I cannot believe that I’m here again doing this 15 months later,” Slotkin said during a news conference Tuesday. “And I am filled with rage that we have to have another press conference to talk about our children being killed in their schools.”
   
      She added, “We have children in Michigan who are living through their second school shooting in under a year and a half. If this is not a wake-up call to do something, I don’t know what is.” 
   
      “I feel for our children and young people,” East Lansing Mayor Ron Bacon told CNN on Tuesday.
   
      “We now have a complete generation that has grown up with this, many times over, from elementary all the way up to now, they live with this the entire time,” Bacon added.
   
      Monday’s assault occurred hours before the five-year anniversary of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. It marked the 67th mass shooting – with four or more shot, not including a gunman – in 2023, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive.
   
      Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard confirmed deputies from his office responded to both the Oxford High and MSU shootings. 
   
      “So very many thoughts are running through my head right now after being on Michigan State’s campus last night during the tragedy,” he tweeted Tuesday.  
   
      “To our Oxford community, I know that this is terribly traumatic. Know that we are here for you.” 
   
      As for Emma Riddle, her father drove from his home in Oxford to the Michigan State campus to pick up his daughter and her roommate. Emma is home for now until classes resume, he said, and she is working through the trauma. 
   
      “She is OK – as OK as she can be,” he said. “It was heartbreaking, as a parent, because she said ‘I have tools to work through this. I have been through this before so I know how to process this.’”
   
      Riddle advised other parents in the same situation as his family to just let their children know they aren’t alone.
   
      “Just being there for them, no matter what they need,” he said. “As much as you are able don’t let them be alone.”

      A Boeing 747 configured as a private VIP jet is being scrapped after having spent just 30 hours in service over 16 flights. 
   
      The aircraft, originally intended for a Saudi royal, sat on the ground for almost 10 years at EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg, located at the border between France, Switzerland and Germany. 
   
      There, it was meant to be fitted with a lavish interior, but that never happened, and after failing to find a new buyer, the plane was eventually flown to Pinal Airpark in Arizona – an aircraft boneyard where retired planes get stripped for parts or stored indefinitely.
   
      The plane is a BBJ, for “Boeing Business Jet” – heavily modified editions of Boeing’s jetliners targeted to governments and corporate clients. Its range of over 10,000 miles and cabin space of about 5,000 square feet are unrivaled by any other business aircraft.
   
      It’s also the most advanced model of the Boeing 747 ever produced – the 747-8 variant – which first flew in 2010 but failed to find commercial success due to being expensive to operate. The final one, delivered to cargo operator Atlas Air in early 2023, marked the end of the 747’s production history, though the variant still has a future in the spotlight: two 747-8s are currently being transformed into the next  Air Force One planes. 
   
      Boeing has sold over 250 BBJs to date, the vast majority of them 737s, which have a broader market appeal. The large, expensive, four-engined BBJ 747-8 was a harder sell: “Ten were built in total, and this is the first one retired,” says Connor Diver, a senior analyst at aviation analytics firm Cirium. “It’s not transparent who exactly is buying them, but it’s a very, very large private aircraft and the only operators or buyers tend to be governments and royal families.”
   
      This particular one was intended for the Saudi Arabian government, and specifically for the Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, but he died in 2011, just months before the scheduled delivery. The plane, which was assigned a mandatory registration code – N458BJ – first flew in May 2012 for testing, and was officially delivered in June 2012.
   
      “According to our database, it flew via possibly San Bernardino and then San Antonio in Texas for a couple of months, and then in December of 2012 it went to Basel,” says Diver.
   
      Typically, large business jets are delivered in what’s called a “green” condition – from the color of the protective coating of the fuselage – which means they are empty inside and the interior needs to be installed.
   
      “I’m guessing that’s the reason it went there initially, to be fitted out,” says Diver. “Of course, that never happened. And it looks like it sat there for 10 years.”
   
      In 2017, orphaned from its original purpose, the plane went up for sale for $95 million – down from an original list price of around $350 million, according to Diver. It was still empty and advertised as “ready for conversion” in a brochure that can still be found online. But it never sold.
   
      “No one apart from a Saudi head of state is going to want a private, four-engine business jet,” says Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at AeroDynamic Advisory. “You can’t convert just one aircraft to cargo, and nobody wants a passenger version. As a consequence, the parts and especially the engines, are worth far more than the airplane.” 
   
      One major hurdle to a sale was the high cost of fitting the interior.
   
      “Fitting one of these out would cost 30, 40 maybe 50 million dollars,” says Diver, “Although you might think it’s a brand new aircraft, the alternate uses for it are rather limited. The commercial passenger variant had a limited production and very few airlines operated it, and they would not be interested in taking any more. So the only other option was potentially another government, but obviously that didn’t happen.”
   
      Boeing, which declined to answer a series of questions about the plane when contacted by CNN, eventually bought it back in 2022, from an aircraft trading company called Aircraft Finance Germany. The plane flew to Arizona on April 15, 2022, adding 10 more hours to its time in the air, representing about a quarter of its total flying time. Its very last takeoff from Basel, was immortalized on YouTube by planespotters. 
   
      At Pinal Airpark, a Boeing contractor is still working on disassembling the plane, which has been stripped of the most valuable parts. “I’ve seen pictures of it and it’s been dismantled already, the engines have already been removed,” says Diver. “They were effectively brand new, and one of them is probably in the region of $20 million, so four would be in the region of $80 million.” 
   
      Major systems like the auxiliary power unit and some of the environmental control systems would also have been among the first to go, according to Aboulafia. 
   
      “Total production of the 747-8 is about 150 aircraft,” he adds. “It’s a small group of users and a small number of aircraft. But on the other hand, they’re going to want to keep those going. I suspect a lot of the components will probably go to the cargo folks.”
   
      It’s unclear whether the plane will be scrapped entirely or put in storage to be harvested for parts later. “What can happen in these cases is that it will sit there until a certain part is needed. They might not necessarily take it all the way down to scrap, and leave it for a few years until somebody wants a specific part,” says Diver.
   
      Nine other BBJ 747s are still being operated by the governments of Egypt, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar and Turkey, according to Diver. With the lifespan of a 747 usually clocking in at 25 to 30 years, this one being retired at just 10 years of age is going to set a record that will be difficult to beat.

      Dino Carlone was frightened when he was diagnosed with bladder cancer three years ago, but his spirits were buoyed when he learned that he could get help from a highly effective drug with a great track record.  
   
      “You’re telling yourself, ‘OK, I have cancer, and it’s a very aggressive cancer, but I’ve got great therapy. There’s great numbers,’ ” said Carlone, 65. 
   
      Carlone was supposed to receive treatment for several years, but he says he only got it for only a few months because his urologist told him there was a shortage of the drug, called Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, or BCG.  
   
      Carlone said he was shocked and angry that in a country as wealthy as the United States, there’s a shortage of an important cancer drug.  
   
      A new report estimates that more than 8,300 US patients a year are not receiving full BCG treatments for their bladder cancer. BCG is an older drug – it has been around for more than 40 years – and relatively inexpensive. Pharmaceutical companies aren’t clamoring to make it.  
   
      “This is a terrible crisis. We should be doing everything we can to give every single one of these patients the best chance of survival,” said Laura Bray, a board member of the End Drug Shortages Alliance, one of the sponsors of the report. “It’s heartbreaking, and we must do better.” 
   
      A spokesperson for Merck, the sole maker worldwide of BCG, wrote in an emailed statement that the company increased production of the drug by 200% between 2012 and 2019 and has been producing it “to the full extent of manufacturing capacity over the past several years.”  
   
      Merck is building a facility to expand production of BCG. The company expects the facility to be completed sometime between late 2025 and late 2026, which includes time for necessary regulatory approvals, according to the statement.
   
      “Our company will continue to work to complete this project and meet patient needs in as timely a manner as possible. Our commitment to [BCG] is at the core of Merck’s mission to save and improve lives. We continue to recognize the impact supply shortages can have on patients when they cannot receive the medicines they need,” the statement says.  
   
      A number of factors are contributing to the shortage, which began in 2019.  BCG is a biologic drug  – which uses bacteria – and so is more complicated to make than many other types of drugs and especially prone to quality control issues.  
   
      Sanofi, the other company that once made BCG, started having production problems in 2012. In 2016, it announced that it would stop making the drug the next year.  
   
      Also, while cases of bladder cancer are slowly increasing, it’s still a relatively small market, and making the drug requires a significant investment.  
   
      In a written statement, a spokesperson for the US Food and Drug Administration said that “whenever a shortage occurs, FDA actively works with manufacturers and other U.S. federal agencies to try to address supply issues for the drug product in shortage.”  
   
      When BCG became available in 1976, it was considered a breakthrough strategy. First used as a tuberculosis vaccine, it contains a weakened bacteria that triggers the immune system to fight the cancer.  
   
      “It’s an absolutely fabulous drug,” said Dr. Benjamin Davies, a spokesperson for the American Urological Association.  
   
      Bladder cancer patients receive six rounds of BCG after surgery and then more treatments every few months for a year or two, depending on the person, according to Davies. The treatment is done in the doctor’s office, using a catheter that delivers the drug directly to the bladder.  
   
      Carlone, of Vero Beach, Florida, said he was supposed to receive BCG doses over a period of about two years. But he said after receiving doses for a few months in early 2020, his urologist told him he wouldn’t be able to get his remaining doses because of the shortage.  
   
      “It’s a very, very frightening circumstance to realize that at that point, what they deem to be an aggressive cancer could in fact come right back,” he said.  
   
      Bladder cancer has a 30% to 40% recurrence rate, said Davies, a professor of urology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.   
   
      “That’s a very high recurrence rate,” he said. “It’s a nasty disease.”   
   
      There are about 82,920 new cases of bladder cancer in the US a year and 16,710 deaths, according to the American Cancer Society.  
   
      For the new report, 20 health care systems and physician practices responded to a survey from Vizient, a health care performance improvement company.  
   
      All of them said they had to use at least one strategy to deal with the BCG shortage, and four of the centers said they couldn’t give BCG at all, according to the report.  
   
      Because of the shortage, the American Urological Association recommends prioritizing doses for higher-risk patients. 
   
      Some medical centers in the survey said they are splitting doses. A vial is supposed to be used for one dose for one patient, but instead, they use it for more than one patient. That could lead to waste, though, because the entire vial needs to used within six hours of opening, said Erin Fox, an adjunct professor at the University of Utah College of Pharmacy and specialist in drug shortages.
   
      Other drugs can be used instead of BCG, but they are more expensive and don’t work as well, Davies said.  
   
      “So not only can’t we give the right drug because of the shortage, but we have to spend more money,” he said.  
   
      BCG is just one of many drugs in shortage, including other cancer drugs for adults and for children.  
   
      Carlone wonders why the FDA can’t do more to persuade companies to make drugs that aren’t necessarily very lucrative.  
   
      “To me, this is a failure,” he said. “As Americans, you rely on [government] institutions, and the institutions are failing as far as I’m concerned.”  
   
      According to the FDA statement, the agency “cannot require a pharmaceutical company to make a drug – or make more of a drug – even if it is medically necessary. In addition, we cannot control how much of a drug is distributed - or which purchasers will be given priority.”  
   
      Marta Wosińska, a former senior FDA official, said the federal government could offer financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies to make drugs that are in shortage, similar to the way the government has paid them to make Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.  
   
      Wosińska, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said it would be “a little bit of a tall order” to expect pharmaceutical companies to make drugs, or increase production of drugs, that aren’t particularly profitable. 
   
      “They have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders, so you can only ask them to do so much,” said Wosińska, who worked on drug shortages as director of the economics staff at the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research before she left the agency in 2016.  
   
      Dr. Yoram Unguru, a member of the core faculty at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, said that “pharmaceutical companies can continue to generate profits while ensuring access to essential medicines.”  
   
      He added that the government has an obligation to fix these shortages.  
   
      “The federal government must take a more hands-on approach and maintain a critical stockpile of essential lifesaving medicines and set prices for medications, akin to existing rate-setting bodies that oversee public utilities,” he said.

      Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania voluntarily checked himself into a hospital on Thursday “to receive treatment for clinical depression,” according to a statement by Adam Jentleson, his chief of staff.
   
      “While John has experienced depression on and off during his life, it only became severe in recent weeks,” Jentleson wrote.
   
In May, during his campaign, Fetterman suffered a stroke as he faced off against Republican Mehmet Oz for the Senate seat.
   
      “After what he’s been through in the past year, there’s probably no one who wanted to talk about his own health less than John. I’m so proud of him for asking for help and getting the care he needs,” his wife, Gisele Barreto Fetterman, tweeted.
   
      “I think it’s fantastic that Sen. Fetterman was working with a provider that recommended he get a higher level of care, and that he was able to access services quickly,” said Kristen Carpenter, chief psychologist in the department of psychiatry and behavioral health at Ohio State University College of Medicine.
   
      “Many patients struggle and suffer with these symptoms for a long time before seeking or getting the help they need,” she added. “At a minimum, you can have relief faster when you’re linked for care.”
   
      Depression after a major illness such as stroke is not uncommon, according to the American Stroke Association.
   
      “After a stroke there are biochemical changes within the brain structure which might put him more at risk for depression,” said stress management expert Dr. Cynthia Ackrill, a fellow at the American Institute of Stress.
   
      “After you’ve had a stroke, it takes more work to do what you did before,” Ackrill added. “So you’re more tired and more stressed, and we know that chronic exposure to the cortisol that comes from stress puts you more at risk for depression.”
   
      No one knows the exact cause for depression, and why it is worse in some people than others, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   
      “It may be caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors,” the CDC noted.
 
      Having a family member with depression raises the risk; so do traumatic experiences such as physical abuse or sexual assault, financial problems and a major life change, such as losing a loved one, the CDC said.
   
      Depression is also more common after having a heart attack or being diagnosed with cancer or chronic pain, and people with anxiety disorders are more likely to suffer from depression, too, the CDC said. Substance abuse, such as alcoholism, is also linked to depressive symptoms.
   
      Feelings of depression can be a side effect of many medications, including common ones such as beta blockers used to treat high blood pressure, some proton pump inhibitors used to treat acid reflux, steroids used for inflammation and pain, hormonal contraceptives and more. A 2018 study found over 37% of US adults used medications that might lead to depression.
   
      Symptoms of depression include an ongoing sad, anxious or vacant mood, along with “feelings of hopelessness, pessimism, guilt, worthlessness or helplessness,” according to the American Stroke Association.
   
      Other symptoms include fatigue and decreased energy; less interest or pleasure in daily activities, including sex; changes in appetite and weight; trouble with memory, concentration, planning and decision-making; sleep changes, such as insomnia or oversleeping; and thoughts of death or suicide.

      Depression can be mild, moderate or severe. Clinical depression, also called major depressive disorder, is the more severe form of depression. 
   
      To be diagnosed with clinical depression “an individual must have five depression symptoms every day, nearly all day, for at least 2 weeks,” according to the National Institute on Mental Health.
   
      “One of the symptoms must be a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in almost all activities. Children and adolescents may be irritable rather than sad,” the institute noted.
   
      “We all experience times of sadness, or lack of interest in things we usually enjoy, or other sorts of depressive symptoms,” Ohio State’s Carpenter said. “However, when someone slips into a major depressive episode that means those symptoms are present daily, for most of the day, and they are functionally impairing — meaning they inhibit one’s ability to work, to interface with their families and loved ones, and to engage in the usual activities of living.”
   
      There are a number of treatments for depression, including antidepressant medications, psychological therapy or a combination of both. Antidepressants typically take between four to eight weeks to work, and it’s not uncommon to try a variety of medications before finding the best for that individual, Carpenter said.
   
      “There are higher levels of care like hospitalization, which provides services available all day to help get you on your recovery journey faster.”
   
      If depression fails to respond to first-line treatments, providers may suggest other medications such as esketamine, Carpenter said. Delivered as a nasal spray by doctors, esketamine is a newer US Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for treatment-resistant depression. 
   
      “It often acts rapidly — typically within a couple of hours — to relieve depression symptoms,” according to the National Institute on Mental Health.
   
      “If you have what we refer to as a treatment-resistant depression, we may use things like TMS — transcranial magnetic stimulation — and we still use ECT, or electroconvulsive therapy. So there really is a large compendium of therapies available,” Carpenter said.
   
      “The key is getting care. The vast majority of people will have their symptoms remit with proper treatment through psychotherapy and/or medication.”

      For at least 10 months after a Covid-19 infection, your immune system can provide good protection against symptomatic illness the next time around, a new study found, and the risk of severe illness is even lower.
   
      The researchers, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Covid-19 Forecasting Team, said their study is the largest review yet of available data on the subject. The study, published Thursday in The Lancet, is a meta-analysis that looks at 65 studies from 19 countries.
   
      Ten-month immunity after Covid-19 infection seems strong against all variants of the coronavirus, the study found. 
   
      “There’s quite a long sustained protection against severe disease and death, almost 90% at 10 months. It is much better than I had expected, and that’s a good thing for the world, right? Given that most of the world has had Omicron,” said Dr. Chris Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.  “It means there’s an awful lot of immunity out there.”
   
      The US is still seeing an average of more than 40,000 new Covid-19 cases per day, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 
      Unlike with other viral infections like measles or chickenpox, protection from Covid-19 does not last forever, so even people who have this so-called natural immunity will probably still need an annual Covid-19 booster, Murray said. But with natural immunity lasting as long as it does, people don’t probably need to get a shot any more often than once a year, he said. 
   
      The researchers found that people who got sick with any pre-Omicron version of the coronavirus, though, had substantially reduced protection against infection from the BA.1 subvariant of Omicron: only 36% at 10 months after infection. 
   
      Generally, protection from infection seems to be at least equal to two doses of mRNA vaccine, at least for the variants through BA.1. The study didn’t include an analysis of protection against XBB and the variants that followed. XBB.1.5 is causing about 75% of current cases, according to the CDC. 
   
      More research will be needed to find out about those later variants, but Murray believes that protection should be about the same.
   
      However, he’s careful to note that the findings don’t mean people should skip a vaccine or booster if it’s recommended. 
   
      “The safest way to get immunity is vaccination,” Murray said.
   
      As of February 8, only about 69% of the total US population has gotten their primary series of vaccines. Only about 16% has gotten a dose of the updated booster, the CDC says.
   
      Natural immunity is protective, but no doctor is going to recommend having a Covid party to catch it on purpose. Without vaccination, a first infection carries a substantial risk of severe illness or death, particularly for people with underlying health conditions. 
   
      There’s also the risk of having symptoms that last a long time, called long Covid. Research has found that a more severe illness means a higher chance of long Covid.
   
      “We never know what we’re setting people up for by going out and getting a disease,” said Dr. Claudia Hoyen, an infectious disease specialist and director of pediatric infection control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, who was not involved in the new study. “It’s always safer to get vaccinated than get sick.”
   
      The higher a level of overall immunity in a population, she said, the less likely it is that an even more dangerous variant could develop. 
   
      Hoyen noted that Covid-19 isn’t going away and said the new study makes a good argument for continuing to monitor for future variants. 
   
      The study had some limitations, including that there wasn’t much research on natural immunity in Africa to include in the analysis. Some of the information about infection status and hospital admissions was also incomplete. And there were only a small number of studies that looked at BA.1 and its sublineages, so there is a need to continue monitoring and analyzing variants.
   
      “What we all worry about is a new variant that has immune escape like Omicron had on the prior variants,” Murray said. “People like to hope the evolution of the virus will lead to less severe forms, but that’s not a guarantee. So we just need to stay vigilant for the possibility of a different variant.”

      The Arizona Court of Appeals has rejected Kari Lake’s challenge to the result of the Arizona gubernatorial election after she appealed an earlier ruling from the superior court.
   
      Lake had requested a declaration from the court that she – and not her opponent, Arizona’s Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs who won the election by about 17,000 votes – was the actual winner of the election.
   
      “Her request for relief fails because the evidence presented to the superior court ultimately supports the court’s conclusion that voters were able to cast their ballots, that votes were counted correctly, and that no other basis justifies setting aside the election results,” the Court of Appeals decision stated.
   
      The appeal rejection marks the latest defeat for Lake, who has continually doubled down on her support for former President Donald Trump and false claims that he 2020 election was stolen, a central rallying call in her 2022 gubernatorial bid.
   
      Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Clint Hickman, a Republican, praised the Arizona Court of Appeals’ rejection of Lake’s claims.
   
      “As we have said, every valid vote was counted in a midterm election that saw near-record turnout,” Hickman said in a statement Thursday, adding: “It’s way past time to move on.”
   
      Lake’s legal team broadly criticized Maricopa County’s management of the election during the superior court trial.
   
      With the appeal, Lake sought to reverse Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson’s conclusion that her team could not prove that someone intentionally caused Maricopa County’s ballot-on-demand printers to malfunction, which Lake falsely claimed was part of a deliberate effort to rig the vote against her.
   
      In a tweet Thursday night, Lake said, “We are NOT finished,” adding that she was planning to take the case to the Arizona Supreme Court.
   
      “Buckle up America,” she said.

      In recent years, there has been a lot of standing around in baseball games, with pitchers taking forever to throw the ball and hitters frequently stepping out of the batter’s box. This year, Major League Baseball will try to speed things along with a clock that caps the amount of time between pitches.
   
      It might sound like a radical idea, but the same concept saved the National Basketball Association nearly 70 years ago. In both cases, the clock was added to accelerate a plodding game.
   
      Baseball games have been getting longer in recent years, dragging on for an average of more than three hours, compared to two-and-a-half hours in the 1970s. It’s even worse in the playoffs, with games often exceeding four hours. 
   
      Baseball hopes to reverse that trend this year, with a 15-second clock for each pitch when the bases are empty, and 20 seconds with runners on base. In addition, batters will be limited to one timeout per at-bat, and there will also be a 30-second timer between hitters. (The sport is making other changes, including banning the defensive infield shift to generate more offense, and making bases slightly larger to increase safety and possibly jumpstart stolen base attempts. All the new rules will be in effect for spring training games, which begin February 24 ahead of the 2023 season Opening Day on March 30.)
   
      For more than 150 years, the lack of a clock on the field has distinguished baseball from other major US team sports, and some baseball purists are sure to object to adding one. “There’s no clock in baseball. And there’s no clock in baseball for a reason,” now-New York Mets star pitcher Max Scherzer said in 2019.
   
      But it’s the growth of interminable games that’s really the break from tradition. 
   
      Last year’s World Series between the Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies, for example, included a four-and-a-half hours game (which went into 10 innings) and a nine-inning game that lasted nearly four hours. In 2020, the New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians slogged through a nine-inning game that lasted a whopping four hours and 50 minutes — longer than some doubleheaders used to take back in the day.
   
      The implementation of the “pitch clock” will lead to more action and less standing around — in other words, more baseball. What could be more traditional than that? Baseball will never be a fast-paced game, but there’s no reason it has to be a slow-paced one. A clock will suck a lot of dead time from the sport and quicken the game.
   
      Baseball has already implemented the clock in the minor leagues, and last season, the average length of games dropped by 25 minutes, from 3:03 to 2:38. So it’s proven to make the game faster.
   
      As the length of MLB games has increased, attendance has gone in the opposite direction, with smaller crowds last season than pre-pandemic levels. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred hopes a clock will help reverse that trend.
   
      MLB faced a similar challenge a half-century ago when dominant pitching led to an era of low-scoring games that eroded attendance. In 1969, the sport responded by lowering the pitcher’s mound, which literally put pitchers and hitters on a more level playing field and led to increased hitting and more scoring. 
   
      Four years later, the American League adopted the designated hitter (or DH, a non-fielding player who’s in the batting lineup, typically replacing the pitcher) to inject yet more offense. Last season, MLB made the DH universal across both leagues.
   
      Now baseball is putting pitchers on a stopwatch for the same reason the NBA adopted the 24-second shot clock in 1954: to make games more entertaining for fans.
   
      Basketball in the early ’50s was often a bore, with teams sitting on leads by passing the ball back-and-forth without attempting to score, and it wasn’t unusual for a team to take five minutes before taking a shot. The nadir of this strategy came in a 1950 game between the Fort Wayne Pistons and the Minneapolis Lakers, who had won the NBA championship in the previous season, the inaugural year of the league.
   
      Pistons coach Murray Mendenhall, realizing he was facing a superior team, ordered his players to stall. At the end of the first quarter, the Pistons led 8-7, and the action was so slow that fans, opponents and even the referees urged the team to attempt more shots. But the Pistons stuck to their guns, and outscored the Lakers 3-1 in the fourth quarter on their way to a 19-18 victory — the lowest scoring game in NBA history.
   
      “Play like that will kill professional basketball,” groused Lakers coach Johnny Kundla. Seven decades later, Sports Illustrated baseball writer and Fox broadcaster Tom Verducci made the same prediction about baseball.
   
      “Dead time in a game since Manfred became commissioner in 2015 has increased 17%,” Verducci wrote last year. “It’s not all on him. Players keep saying they don’t want to be told to hurry it up, cluelessly slow-playing their own way into oblivion.” The MLB Players Association opposed rules changes to add a clock (and ban defensive shifts). 
   
      Back in the early ’50s, the owner of the NBA’s Syracuse Nationals, an Italian immigrant and bowling alley proprietor named Danny Biasone, knew the league had to make basketball more exciting for fans.
   
      ”I’m not an expert on the game,” Biasone told The New York Times in 1984. ”I never claimed to be. But I knew fans weren’t paying to see the ball being dribbled around all night. So I went to those fellas in the league and said I’m having a tough time selling something here. There’s one thing basketball needs, I said. It needs a time. I don’t care what the time is. Put in a time!”
   
      NBA owners knew they had to do something — nine of the 17 franchises had folded in the previous four years, and the league was becoming irrelevant at a time when baseball reigned as America’s most popular sport. That’s why, in April 1954, the NBA adopted the clock in an attempt to end stalling.
   
      The impact was immediate: average team scoring per game increased from 79 points to 93. That figure rose to 106 by 1958, and not coincidentally, attendance soared by 40%.
   
      “The adoption of the clock was the most important event in the NBA, and Danny Biasone is the most important man in the NBA,” said Maurice Podoloff, who was league president at the time. Today, basketball is a thrilling game, with superstars showing off their talent in constant action.
   
      As for baseball, New York Mets announcer Keith Hernandez, a former star player, said the game has gotten too slow even for him. “I honestly feel that when I’m retired, when I stop doing what I’m doing now in the booth, I won’t watch baseball that much anymore,” he said in January. “It’s three-hour games now, three-and-a-half, when I played it was two-and-a-half. I still love the game, but they’re lengthy.”
   
      Baseball has long struggled to attract young fans, in part because of the slow pace of play. When the sport starts losing 69-year-old baseball lifers like Hernandez, you know it has a problem. 
   
      People don’t come to games to watch guys stand around and do nothing — whether it’s on a basketball court or a baseball diamond. A clock won’t have the same dramatic effect on baseball that it had on the NBA. But for Americans with limitless entertainment options and limited time, it will help attract fans with more exciting (and faster) baseball games than we’ve seen in years.

Unfortunately for car buyers, that could be about to change.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/18/business/used-car-prices/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230217152633-us-used-car-prices-0215.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-02-18T18:27:39Z,"
      The price of used cars has been falling steadily, and steeply, for much of the last year. Unfortunately for car buyers, that could be about to change.
   
      Wholesale prices for used cars being sold at auction have risen sharply in the last few weeks, according to industry data. Higher retail prices on used car dealer lots are likely to be close behind.
   
      According to data from Manheim, the largest wholesale automotive marketplace, prices jumped 4% in just the last two weeks, an unusually large increase in such a short time period. While many in the industry expected the drop in prices wouldn’t last, the sudden increase caught many by surprise.
   
      “We did not anticipate that prices would jump as much as they have,” said Chris Frey, senior industry insights manager at Cox Automotive, which owns Manheim. “It made my eyes jump out.”
   
      Dealers started pulling back on their inventory of used cars as prices were declining late last year and into January. Much of the decline began late last year as a larger supply of new cars became available for purchase.
   
      A shortage of parts, particularly computer chips, caused automakers to scale their production back far below the demand for new vehicles, and push potential new car buyers, even rental car companies, into the used car market. That shortage of new car inventory helped drive both new and use car prices to record levels earlier last year.
   
      But part supplies and computer chip inventory improved in the last half of 2022, and with that used car prices started to decline. In January used car prices were down 11.6% from the year earlier, according to the Consumer Price Index, the government’s key inflation reading – the biggest 12-month decline since the depths of the Great Recession in early 2009.
   
      The busy selling season for used cars is only months away — it’s tied to when potential buyers get their tax refunds. Now dealers are scrambling to rebuild inventories, and that is driving up prices.
   
      The strong labor market, with employers unexpectedly adding more than 500,000 jobs in January, is also driving demand for used cars.
   
      “If you want to point at one factor that drives demand for cars, it’s jobs,” said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds. “If you’ve got a job, you’ve got a car.”
   
      Part of the problem in the months ahead can be traced to the early days of the pandemic three years ago. The disruptions to the new car market at that time are about to be felt by today’s used car market.
   
      In March and April of 2020, auto plants across the nation were shut by stay-at-home orders, and many dealerships were closed. Demand for cars also fell off a cliff amid record job losses and millions of additional workers shifted to working from home rather than commuting.
 
      So the 2020 plunge in car sales meant that few people were signing up for three-year leases on new vehicles, contracts that would normally be coming to an end now and in turn feed those vehicles into the supply of used cars on the markets. 
   
      “The repercussions of the pandemic are coming through,” Drury said. “The supply is definitely not going to be there.” The disruptions in the car markets in 2020 and early 2021 could affect used car prices much of the year. 
   
      “We are entering a period of tight supply on 3- and 4-year-old vehicles, which make up the majority of [used] car sales,” said Michael Manley, CEO of AutoNation
            
                (AN), the nation’s largest car dealership, in a call with investors Friday. “And that’s going to impact wholesale prices and ultimately, retail prices.”
   
      It’s tough to know how long the rise in used car prices will last.
   
      The labor market and consumer spending is strong at the moment, but there are still worries about a possible recession. The Federal Reserve appears likely to keep raising interest rates, at least in the near term, which in turn will raise the cost of car loans, and for the financing that car dealers use when purchasing their own inventories. 
   
      The drop in used car prices has been a major factor in the slowing of inflation, but a sustained rise in used car prices could make it more difficult for the Fed to pull back on rate hikes. 
   
Overall prices are up 6.4% over the last 12 months, according to CPI, but that reading has fallen for seven straight months. And prices would have risen 6.9% over the same 12 month period if used car prices had posted such a steep decline and instead just stayed unchanged. 
 
      So broader economic conditions in the US economy are certain to have an effect on supply, demand and pricing of used cars, which makes forecasting future prices very difficult, said Frey.
   
      “I don’t think this latest increase is a blip. But I imagine prices could come down after spring and tax refunds land,” said Frey. But he added that forecasts are tough to make in the current market.
   
      “We’ve been calling for a 4% decline in prices from December last year to December this year,” Frey said. “We may have to revise that.”

      It was 4:05 a.m. in Melbourne when Andy Murray drilled a backhand winner past Thanasi Kokkinakis, finally ending a marathon contest which had started five hours and 45 minutes earlier. 
   
      Murray, a three-time grand slam champion and former world No. 1, had come from two sets down to beat Kokkinakis at the Australian Open, laying bare all the grit and determination that has typified his tennis career. 
   
      Kokkinakis, too, deserves huge credit for continuing to fight well into small hours of Thursday morning when most in Australia had long been in bed. 
   
      But as the players emptied all their energy reserves on Margaret Court Arena, many came away wondering why a match was still being played past 4 a.m.
   
      Among them was Murray himself, who fumed at not being allowed to go to the toilet having already taken a bathroom break earlier in the match. 
   
      “It’s so disrespectful that the tournament has us out here until three, f***ing four in the morning and we’re not allowed to take a piss,” the Scot vented. 
   
      Murray’s brother, doubles specialist Jamie, shared the frustration of his sibling, tweeting during the second-round match: “We can’t continue to have players compete into the wee hours of the morning. Rubbish for everyone involved – players/fans/event staff.”
   
      The Australian Open has a demanding schedule in the early rounds of the tournament; five matches are regularly played each day on the show courts – three during the day session and two at night. 
   
      The match between Murray and Kokkinakis was the second-latest finish in the history of the Australian Open.
   
      In 2008, Lleyton Hewitt secured victory over Marcos Baghdatis in five sets at 4:33 a.m. after Roger Federer had taken four and a half hours to defeat Janko Tipsarevic earlier in the day.
   
      Those late finishes are good news for international viewers in Europe and North America, who are able to enjoy the drama and tension of a five-set match, but less good for those involved in the spectacle itself.
   
      “I really think this is a nightmare for tennis,” Simon Cambers, a tennis writer and co-author of The Roger Federer Effect, tells CNN Sport. 
   
      “The players involved in these night matches are badly affected and their chances of progression are slim. 
   
      “Very few people in Australia would have stayed up to watch the whole match and though international viewing figures would have been good, the game needs to be about more than money. 
   
      “Many others are affected, too, including staff, officials, media, ball kids, all of whom have to work ludicrous hours, which leaves them tired and not doing their jobs as well. What other elite sport plays until 4 a.m.? It’s crazy.”
   
      CNN has contacted Tennis Australia regarding the scheduling of the Australian Open but did not immediately receive a response. 
   
      Murray, who plays Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in the third round on Saturday, was back practicing on Margaret Court Arena on Friday, eight hours after the conclusion of his match against Kokkinakis. 
   
      In that time, he would have fulfilled his media responsibilities, warmed down, had something to eat, traveled back to his hotel, and, once the adrenaline of the match subsided, slept. 
   
      Australian Open organizers, however, see no need to immediately change the tournament scheduling after the late-night finish. 
   
      “We have to protect the matches,” Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley told Australian broadcaster Nine. “If you just put one match at night and there’s an injury, you don’t have anything for fans or broadcasters.
   
      “At this point, there is no need to alter the schedule. We always look at it when we do the debrief like we do every year; we’ve had long matches before, at this point we’ve got to fit the matches in in the 14 days so you don’t have many options.”
   
      Cambers thinks it would be worth exploring the option of shortening men’s matches to best of three sets in the earlier rounds to ease pressure on the schedule, then reverting to best of five from the fourth round onwards.
   
      “Before anyone starts yelling about tradition, it has been done before, back in the 1970s,” he says.
   
      “If they don’t want to change the schedule, then make matches shorter and less epic by speeding up courts and balls. That way, rallies and matches will not leave everyone spent and potentially, it could lengthen a player’s career.”
   
      Murray, who also needed five sets to defeat Matteo Berrettini in the first round, is scheduled to play in the first match of the night session on Margaret Court Arena on Saturday. 
   
      Both he and opponent Bautista Agut, who came from two sets down to beat Brandon Holt in the second round, will be hoping for quicker wins this time around.
   
      But history isn’t particularly kind to them on that front: the previous occasion they met in Melbourne, Bautista Agut triumphed in five sets and more than four hours. 
   
      Perhaps we should prepare for another marathon roller coaster at the Australian Open.

      The US Food and Drug Administration declined to grant accelerated approval to an experimental Alzheimer’s drug, donanemab, and requested additional data from Eli Lilly and Company, the drug maker. 
   
      The company, which announced the development on Thursday, plans to file Phase 3 clinical trial data later this year for a traditional FDA approval. 
   
      The findings in a previous Phase 2 trial, published in May in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggested that treatment with donanemab could lead to “modestly less cognitive and functional decline” in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease, but the drug was associated with some adverse events, such as cerebral swelling or effusions, which were mostly asymptomatic.
   
      In that trial, the researchers looked at the drug’s impact on the buildup of amyloid beta plaque and tau proteins, which are considered hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.
   
      “We look forward to our upcoming confirmatory TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase 3 results and subsequent FDA submission, which we’ve always seen as the most impactful next steps for patients,” Anne White, executive vice president and president of Lilly Neuroscience at Eli Lilly, said in a news release.
   
      “We anticipate this study will confirm the benefit and safety profile we observed in the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Phase 2 study and believe that patients and physicians will be well served by having the full Phase 3 data available alongside our Phase 2 data when they need to make treatment decisions,” she said. “We are committed to working with the FDA to ensure the fastest possible path to bring this potential medicine to patients in need.”
   
      The experimental intravenous drug donanemab is not a cure, but intended to slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s patients. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia. The debilitating disease now affects more than 6 million adults in the United States.
   
      The Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation released a statement Thursday in response to the FDA decision, describing it as being due to “the limited number of patients” who stayed on donanemab for at least 12 months, which is the timeframe the FDA wants to see to assess the drug’s safety.
   
      “This drug did what it was intended to do – remove amyloid plaques in the brain – and because of the trial’s innovative design, treatment was halted for patients once the biomarker PET scans confirmed the plaques were gone. In some cases, this occurred in less than 12 months, which is why fewer patients stayed on the drug for a full year,” Dr. Howard Fillit, co-founder and chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, said in the statement. 
   
      “The ADDF applauds the design of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial, which is a mark of great progress in the Alzheimer’s field, promising more treatments to come. We look forward to reviewing the phase 3 data later this year,” Fillit said. “Amyloid-clearing drugs, such as these, are one part of the solution, but there remains a pressing need to develop a new generation of drugs targeting all aspects of the biology of aging that can be combined to address the full array of underlying pathologies that contribute to the disease.”
   
      Donanemab is just one of more than 300 Alzheimer’s treatments are in clinical trials, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. Earlier this month, the FDA granted accelerated approval for the Alzheimer’s disease drug lecanemab, marketed as Leqembi, one of the first experimental dementia drugs to appear to slow the progression of cognitive decline.
   
      The Alzheimer’s Association also released a statement Thursday in response to the FDA’s determination that more data are needed to reach a decision on donanemab.
   
      That move by the FDA “demonstrates the rigorous approach the agency takes in reviewing individual treatments,” and the association “appreciates” the FDA’s process, according to the statement.
   
      “The donanemab Phase 2 Alzheimer’s trial showed significant slowing of decline on a measure of memory, thinking and daily function in people living with early Alzheimer’s, compared to placebo,” the statement said. “On behalf of our constituents, we look forward to the Phase 3 trial topline data read-out expected later this year, and the outcome of ongoing discussions between the company and the FDA.”

      The real estate market took a downward turn in 2022, as rising interest rates rapidly slowed the frenzied sales activity seen the year before — but home prices still hit a record high.
   
      The median home sale price in 2022 was $386,300, up 10.2% from 2021 and the highest on record, according to data from the National Association of Realtors released Friday. 
   
      Meanwhile home sales had their weakest year since 2014, with 5.03 million homes sold, down 17.8% from the year before. It was the biggest annual drop in sales since 2008, when the market was in the midst of the housing crisis. 
   
      Sales of existing homes — which include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops — declined for the 11th month in a row in December, even as surging mortgage rates that were over 7% in November came down slightly. Buyers were kept out of the market by stubbornly high prices and rates still double what they were the year before.
   
      In December, sales dropped 1.5% from November and were down 34% from a year ago. All regions of the country saw year-over-year declines in sales, and three regions saw month-to-month drops, with the West unchanged.
   
      But prices kept rising in December, with a median price of $366,900, up 2.3% from a year ago, which is the smallest price gain since the lockdown period in May 2020. The price increase marks more than a decade of year-over-year monthly gains.
   
      “December was another difficult month for buyers, who continue to face limited inventory and high mortgage rates,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “However, expect sales to pick up again soon, since mortgage rates have markedly declined after peaking late last year.”
 
      After 2021’s real-estate boom fueled by some of the lowest mortgage rates on record, 2022’s rise in rates in clamped down demand and slowed home price growth. Now, the housing market is transitioning to something closer to typical in the year ahead, experts say.
   
      “After the boom of sales in 2021, 2022 was a transition year in which sales declined sizeably,” said Yun. “We know there are concerns about the housing market tumbling down and sales have come down, but the prices are up for the year.”
   
      While the 10% gain in median home prices over the year was less than the 17% annual gain in 2021, month-by-month price appreciation got smaller throughout 2022 with a 15.4% annual price increase in January dwindling to December’s 2.3% price growth from the prior year. 
   
      “December’s price gain is close to 0%, which means half of the country is seeing some kind of price declines and other half is seeing price increases,” said Yun. Areas where prices had the largest jumps in prices over the past few years —- Phoenix; Austin, Texas; and Las Vegas — are also places seeing prices drop by the most.
   
      From the pre-Covid end of 2019 to the end of 2022 median prices have soared 42%, said Yun, translating into a $114,000 increase in housing wealth for the typical homeowner.
   
      But for those who do not own a home, he added, home prices have risen much faster than income. That presents affordability challenges for many would-be buyers.
   
      December’s existing home sales report hit the losing trifecta of lower sales, lower inventory and higher prices, said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.
   
      The one bright spot, he said, was that December home prices only increased 2.3% from a year earlier. 
   
      “In many markets, we’re seeing home prices fall from inflated levels, which spells opportunity for some prospective buyers,” said Frick. “However, while mortgage rates have fallen a full percentage point to about 6%, that level is still too high to encourage many more listings and much more buying.”
   
      While inventory in December is up from a year ago, total housing inventory is still under one million units, which is historically low. 
   
      Properties typically remained on the market for 26 days in December, up from 24 days in November and 19 days in December 2021, according to NAR. Over half of homes sold in December 2022 were on the market for less than a month. This is still, historically, a swift market, without a glut of available homes.
   
      Inventory of homes for sale remains stubbornly low because many would-be home sellers are reluctant to part with the ultra-low mortgage rate they bought or refinanced into over the past few years.
   
      As of the third quarter of 2022, the overwhelming majority of outstanding mortgages have a rate at or below 6%, according to Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. 
   
      “That leaves many existing homeowners in a position where it would cost more to borrow the same amount of money they owe on their current mortgage, which prevents them from listing their home for sale and adding supply to the market,” said Fleming.
   
      “The good news is that new-home inventory is on the rise, and total inventory usually picks up heading into the spring season,” he said. “The residential housing market suffered a deep freeze in the winter months of 2022, but there is reason to believe that it will begin to thaw as the spring home-buying season approaches.”

Japan will consider downgrading Covid-19 to the same category as seasonal influenza this spring, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced Friday.
   
      Kishida said he had instructed Health Ministry officials to discuss the move and his administration would also review rules on face masks and other pandemic measures.
   
      “In order to further advance the efforts of ‘living with Corona’ and restore Japan to a state of normalcy, we will transition the various policies and measures to date in phases,” Kishida said.
   
      While daily Covid-19 cases in Japan have declined in recent weeks, the country still faces around 100,000 new infections a day.  
   
      Covid-19 is categorized as a Class 2 disease, the same status as tuberculosis and avian influenza, according to Japan’s Health Ministry. Officials will now discuss reclassifying it to Class 5 – the lowest rank, which includes  seasonal flu.
   
      Japan fully reopened its borders to overseas visitors last October after more than two years of pandemic restrictions, ending one of the world’s strictest border controls.
   
      Influenza – or the common flu – and Covid-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses with simlar symptoms, but they are caused by different viruses and require testing to confirm a diagnosis, the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says on its website.
   
      According to the CDC, the risk of death or hospitalization from Covid-19 is greatly reduced for most people due to high levels of vaccination and population immunity from previous infections.
   
      However, the World Health Organization still lists the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic, and reiterated in its latest update a recommendation for people to wear masks following recent exposure or close contact with Covid-19, and for “anyone in a crowded, enclosed, or poorly ventilated space” to do the same.
   
      WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on governments last week to continue sharing the sequencing data of the coronavirus, as it remained vital to detect and track the emergence and spread of new variants.
   
      “It’s understandable that countries cannot maintain the same levels of testing and sequencing they had during the Omicron peak. At the same time, the world cannot close its eyes and hope this virus will go away. It won’t,” he said.
   
      The news came as South Korea announced it will lift its mask mandate for most indoor areas, with exceptions for public transport and health facilities. The changes will take effect on January 30, South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said Friday.
   
      The measure will be lifted after the Lunar New Year holiday, when a large number of people are expected to travel, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said.
   
      New Covid-19 cases, severe cases and related deaths are all declining and the country’s medical response capacity remains stable, KDCA added.
   
      The agency has strongly recommended people wear masks if they have Covid-19 related symptoms, belong to a high-risk group, have been in contact recently with a positive case, or are in a crowded space. 
   
      The prime minister said the easing of the mandate could result in a temporary surge of new cases and urged health authorities to stay vigilant. 
   
      South Korea has scrapped most of its pandemic restrictions and eased its outdoor mask mandate in May 2022. It still requires people who test positive to undergo seven days of home isolation. 
   
      The country has also restricted travel from mainland China and implemented testing requirements for people arriving from China, Hong Kong and Macau following Beijing’s easing of Covid restrictions.

      South Korea’s leader is capping off a whirlwind week, after securing tens of billions of dollars in investment from the Middle East and vowing to have his country play a more important role in revitalizing international supply chains.
   
      On Monday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol announced that the United Arab Emirates had pledged a staggering $30 billion in investment in the Asian country.
   
      The news came after the leaders of the two nations held talks in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, in a landmark trip that marked the first-ever state visit to the UAE by a South Korean president, according to a statement from Yoon’s office.
   
      The investment aims to increase cooperation in the fields of nuclear, hydrogen and solar energy, as well as defense, along with an agreement to form a “special strategic partnership” at the highest level, the statement said.
   
      Yoon was joined in the region by a delegation of Korean tycoons, including the billionaire leaders of Samsung, Hyundai Motors
            
                (HYMTF) and SK Group. In total, representatives from approximately 100 South Korean companies traveled with the president, according to his office.
   
      During the four-day visit, two dozen agreements worth $6.1 billion covering nuclear power, defense and green energy were signed by businesses from the two sides, according to the South Korean government. 
   
      Some South Korean firms also agreed to build farms for tomatoes and strawberries in the UAE, a country that relies heavily on imports of agricultural products. 
   
      The flurry of deals came just days before Yoon addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he discussed the importance of repairing global supply chains. 
   
      “The most urgent task of our time is to strengthen the supply chain’s resilience based on reciprocal solidarity,” he said in a speech Thursday, noting recent disruptions in the supplies of food, energy, computer chips, vaccines and pharmaceuticals across the globe.
   
      “The pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, the rivalry for technological hegemony, and the weakening multilateral trade system have led to the fragmentation of the global supply chain, causing it to reshape,” Yoon continued, adding that the war in Ukraine had exacerbated the situation.
   
      The president said the issue had led to a “trend of bloc-forming among countries,” with international cooperation “increasingly regarded as a package deal.” 
   
      “Building up walls and intensifying protectionism cannot be the right answer,” Yoon added.
   
      Going forward, South Korea “will be a key partner in the global supply chain,” using its expertise in sectors such as semiconductors and steel-making to help stabilize supply chains, he pledged. “We will align and cooperate with mutually trusted countries.”

      America’s culture wars are becoming a feedback loop between the far right and far left. They deepen our divisions and often don’t reflect reality.   
   
      Increasingly, the front lines of these fights take place in the realm of language, with self-appointed word police rushing to the ramparts to defend against cultural insults, both real and imagined.   
   
      The first weeks of 2023 have already shown these word police busy at work imposing politically-driven prohibitions.   
   
      Take Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who decided to make one of her first actions in office a ban on the word “Latinx” in all official state documents.    
   
      The term is obscure for many – a relatively recent attempt to come up with a gender-neutral alternative to “Latino” and “Latina.” Among its many problems – beyond virtue-signaling pretension – is the fact that the vast majority of US Hispanics do not use the term. According to a 2020 Pew Research survey, just 25% of Hispanics have even heard the word and only 3% actually use it. In 2021, Gallup similarly found that only 4% of Hispanic and Latino Americans prefer Latinx. 
   
      So if the term Latinx is basically not used by the Latino community itself, why would Sanders feel the need to ban it? After all, it’s not like the offending word was widely used by her Republican predecessor, Asa Hutchinson, or the previous administration of her father, Mike Huckabee. Well, it’s a performance for right-wing national media because “owning the libs” is a critical component of conservative celebrity, even when it runs roughshod over alleged first principles like freedom of speech.  
   
      But the cultural irritants the right is reacting against are also not entirely a phantom menace – and they don’t just annoy conservatives. For example, progressive Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego tweeted in 2021 that his office would not use the term Latinx, arguing that “When Latino politicos use the term it is largely to appease White rich progressives who think that is the term we use. It is a vicious circle of confirmation bias.”  
   
      Speaking of the vicious circle of confirmation bias, the same week that Latinx was being banned in Arkansas, the University of Southern California’s School of Social Work decided to formally ban the use of the word “field” from its curriculum.  
   
      Why? Well, according to a memo, the school’s rationale is that someone might be offended by the term because it “could be considered anti-Black or anti-immigrant” – explaining that “phrases such as ‘going into the field’ or ‘field work’ may have connotations for descendants of slavery and immigrant workers that are not benign.”   
   
      Pay attention to the verbs “could” and “may” – because they acknowledge that this language ban is a matter of possible feelings not rooted in actual, etymological fact. This fits Bill Maher’s definition of political correctness: “the elevation of sensitivity over truth.” And that’s especially ironic in academia, where words are supposed to carry weight because of their precise meaning.  
   
      Because as a glance at the Merriam-Webster dictionary makes clear, the phrase “field work” has precisely nothing to do with slaves or migrant labor working in literal fields. Instead, it’s primary educational definition is as follows: “work done in the field (as by students) to gain practical experience and knowledge through firsthand observation.”
   
      These two examples from one week in January 2023 are worth calling out not just because of their mirror image absurdity. They also provide a useful look at the differences between the far-right and the far-left in the culture wars.  
   
      Sanders is the elected governor of one of America’s 50 states. She has real world political power and responsibility.  
   
      The University of Southern California School of Social Work language ban is the result of a few academics without direct political power and a modest degree of cultural influence. Their decision likely drew more negative attention than real world impact.  
   
      It’s an illustration of how Democrats often bear the political cost of random academics and activists while Republicans often elevate their culture warriors to elected office, presenting themselves as defenders of comparative common sense. It’s just one more example of asymmetric polarization. What’s truly perplexing is why folks on the far-left don’t see how their actions help to recruit and fundraise for the conservative cause while alienating many of the independent voters that Democrats need to attract to win elections in a country where conservatives and moderates each outnumber liberals by a considerable margin. 
   
      A final example of a recent word police scandal hammers home the point. Stanford University did not, in fact, ban the use of the word “American.” This may be contrary to what you read in December.   
   
      Here’s what happened. The Stanford IT Department published internal guidance on language as part of its Orwellian sounding “The Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative” – created in conjunction with its People of Color in Technology affinity group. This presumably well-intentioned list galloped toward the embodiment of far-left wing stereotypes – especially in suggesting using the word “American” in favor of “US Citizen,” explaining that the allegedly offending term insinuated “that the US is the most important country in the Americas (which is actually made up of 42 countries).” 
   
      This sparked a predictable firestorm. Yes, it was clueless and hopelessly out of touch. But keep in mind that this internal language guidance was not indicative of Stanford University policy as a whole. It was not a ban. It was just someone’s really bad idea offered as guidance to a relatively small group of people. But the self-created straw-man, once taken out of context, quickly came to symbolize the worst version of conservative suspicions about the unpatriotic and censorious impulses of folks on the far-left. The liberal wing of the word police just do not seem to know (or care) how uptight, humorless and scolding they sound – or how their intentions provide one of the most potent forms of recruitment for the right.  
   
      In this case, Stanford at least took the note from the outside world. Soon after the scandal broke, the school tried to clarify its intent, writing: “To be very clear, not only is the use of the term ‘American’ not banned at Stanford, it is absolutely welcomed. The intent of this particular entry on the EHLI website was to provide perspective on how the term may be imprecise in some specific uses, and to show that in some cases the alternate term ‘US citizen may be more precise and appropriate. But, we clearly missed the mark in this presentation.”  
   
      That’s an understatement. The word police defined university policy in the public mind for a time. No surprise that earlier this month, the Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative was itself eliminated.
   
      The word police make us feel more divided than we really are. We need to stop this feedback loop between the extremes. Rep. Gallego was right when he called it a “vicious circle of confirmation bias.” A more consistent commitment to liberal values – including free speech and fact-based debates - might help us move away from these polarizing outbursts of groupthink and group blame. After all, democracy depends on an assumption of goodwill between fellow citizens - and that’s strained when the word police come knocking.

      The fates of three members and one associate of the Oath Keepers are in the hands of a Washington, DC, jury that will decide whether they committed several federal crimes, including seditious conspiracy, on January 6, 2021.  
   
      Prosecutors allege that defendants, led by Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes, plotted to violently stop Joe Biden from being certified as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.  
   
      “American Democracy is fragile,” Prosecutor Louis Manzo told the jury Wednesday, encouraging them to find the four defendants guilty. “It will not survive if people who are not satisfied with an election use force and violence to change the outcome.”  
   
      Manzo continued, “The defendants could not let this election stand, they could not let Biden come to power.” The men, Manzo said, acted violently and justified their attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power by citing the Founding Fathers, which he called a “perverted version of American history.”
   
      Eight people associated with the far-right group were charged with conspiring together, but prosecutors split the large group into two separate trials because of space limitations in the DC federal courthouse. The first trial, against five alleged leaders of the group including Rhodes, finished in November. Rhodes and one other man were found guilty of seditious conspiracy, while the other three defendants were found guilty of various felony charges.
   
      The defendants currently on trial are Roberto Minuta, an Oath Keeper from New Jersey who prosecutors described as one of  Rhodes’ “most trusted men”; Joseph Hackett, an alleged recruiter for the Florida Oath Keeper who prosecutors said is talented at hiding his identity; David Moerschel, an alleged part of the so-called stack formation that prosecutors said acted as a “battering ram,” pushing through the mob and into the Capitol; and Edward Vallejo, one of the alleged leaders of the armed quick reaction force, who prosecutors said called for “guerilla war” the morning of January 6. 
   
      The defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges brought by the government.
   
      In closing arguments Wednesday, defense attorneys for the four men argued that their clients had not conspired together to stop a Biden presidency, saying that the government’s case presented no proof of a plan to storm the US Capitol.  
   
      “The government has built its case on selective evidence and scary words,” William Shipley, the attorney for Minuta, told the jury. “They control the information … they give you what they want you to see.”  
   
      Jury deliberations began late Thursday morning.
   
      On Wednesday, Manzo walked the jury through weeks of trial testimony and told the jurors to ignore defense attorneys’ arguments that the four men are innocent because they were merely following Rhodes.
   
      “This is not a case where someone was in the wrong place at the wrong time or had the worst beginner’s luck,” Manzo said. The law does not require that each person played an “equal role” in the conspiracy to be found guilty, Manzo said, but rather that that “they talked together, they acted together, and they deleted together.” 
   
      Instead, he implored jurors to focus on evidence of how the four defendants, fueled by Rhodes, turned to increasingly violent rhetoric after the presidential election. He showed jurors violent messages and videos of the defendants, including one where Minuta, driving to Washington, DC, screams that “millions will die…get your f**king soul ready.”
   
      “This isn’t ‘Twitter fingers,’ this isn’t a pop song,” Manzo continued, chiding Moerschel’s defense attorney Scott Weinberg who compared the violent rhetoric to a Drake song in his opening statement. “These are men trucking guns across the country to oppose the government by force.”  
   
      As Manzo spoke, two federal agents stood by him holding rifles that were stockpiled as part of the QRF. When the agents stood, the juror sitting closest to the agents physically recoiled.  
   
      On January 6, Hackett and Moerschel, with other members of the far-right militia, allegedly put their hands on the shoulders of the person in front of them, pushed into the Capitol and moved towards then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office. Minuta was not initially at the Capitol but sped over in a golf cart when he learned of the breach, prosecutors said. Once inside, he allegedly joined a crowd pushing against police and screamed, “This was bound to happen.”  
   
      “How far would Minuta have gone if law enforcement had not pushed him back,” Manzo asked. “He called for lawmakers to be hung.” Manzo pointed the jurors to testimony from one of the officers who faced-off against Minuta, and how, in that moment, the officer said he “thought of his daughter and how he wasn’t sure he was going home.”   
   
      All the while, Manzo said, Vallejo – who earlier that day allegedly said that if Congress certified the election, “I am the m*therf**ker that’s gonna fix it” – was waiting across the Potomac River offering over and over to deploy the QRF. Despite his messages, no one replied to Vallejo and the QRF was not deployed.   
   
      Attorneys for the defendants repeatedly argued that not only was the government manipulating evidence but that there was no proof of a conspiracy between the group, arguing that while the jury might find statements from their clients offensive, that wasn’t reason to convict them of plotting to stop the certification of the election.  
   
      Angela Halim, Hackett’s attorney, told the jury that the government had presented a “heavily edited reality show relying on repetition” and was guilty of “plucking” out selective words from the defendants. 
   
      Halim said her client was guilty of trespassing on Capitol grounds but it was not part of some larger plan. Hackett has not been charged with the misdemeanor offense of unlawfully entering Capitol grounds and instead faces counts including obstructing an official proceeding and destruction of government property, as well as the seditious conspiracy charge.
   
      “The breach of the Capitol was a surprise to every single Oath Keeper that day,” Halim said.  
   
      Several of the attorneys cited testimony from Brian Ulrich, an Oath Keeper who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy in April, and said that Ulrich confirmed there was never any plan in the group to stop the certification that day or violently keep Biden out of the White House.  
   
      “These men just talked tough,” Weinberg told the jury. “They never actually back it up.” 
   
      Weinberg said that Moerschel quickly left the Capitol after entering and never confronted police that day.  
   
      The Oath Keepers, Weinberg argued, was nothing more than a personal “piggy bank” for Rhodes, calling it a “disorganized group” that Moerschel quickly left after the events of January 6.

449,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Mary Ziegler, Aziza Ahmed",Opinion: What the FDA's moves on abortion pills mean for the future,"While it's true that the White House may not be able to ensure abortion access in states with criminal bans, a Republican president just might be able to make sure that abortion pills are unavailable in places where abortion is legal — or even a protected rig…",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/20/opinions/abortion-pill-pharmacy-white-house-ziegler-ahmed-ctrp/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220713163757-misoprostol-file-062022.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-01-20T18:15:15Z,"
      This month, the US Food and Drug Administration announced that retail pharmacies will be able to sell the abortion pill mifepristone for the first time. 
   
      The move — which will allow pharmacies to request certification to offer the pill and then fill valid prescriptions for it — is part of the Biden administration’s effort to address the erasure of abortion rights in many areas of the US. 
   
      As a White House statement put it this summer, the goal is “to identify all ways to ensure that mifepristone is as widely accessible as possible”. 
   
      Since then, the FDA and the administration as a whole have faced pressure to expand access to abortion medication — or even contend that state laws criminalizing the pills are preempted by the FDA’s approval of them.  
   
      The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists hailed the FDA’s move to widen access to mifepristone as “an important step” in expanding access. And already, two of the nation’s largest pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, have announced that they will seek certification to distribute the pills. 
   
      But this question must be asked and answered: Will the FDA’s decision to allow pharmacies to dispense the abortion pill make a tangible difference?
   
      While the move sends an important signal that the administration is supportive of increasing access to abortion pills, the reality is much more complicated.  A person seeking abortion medication would still require a prescription from a physician in order to access the pills. 
   
      For some women, especially those in states with complete or nearly complete abortion bans, it will still be illegal to mail abortion pills or to fill prescriptions for them (CVS and Walgreens have noted that they will only keep certification to dispense the pills in states where it’s legally allowed). For the women who need it most, the rule change does little.  
   
      So, the FDA’s announcement may not be as transformational as the Biden administration would have us think, but it does deliver a potent reminder of the stakes of the 2024 election: Who sits in the White House may, in part, decide the fate of abortion pills. 
   
      While it’s true that the White House may not be able to ensure abortion access in states with criminal bans, a Republican president just might be able to make sure that abortion pills are unavailable in places where abortion is legal — or even a protected right.  
   
      The abortion issue seems to have been costly for Republicans during the midterm, and it may make sense for them to proceed cautiously, even after 2024. Within the GOP, many, including former President Donald Trump, have blamed the Republican stance on abortion for the GOP’s poor showing in the midterm. 
   
      When majority leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana unveiled House Republicans’ priorities, his proposals on abortion were strikingly unambitious. And some anti-abortion groups are promoting more elaborate proposals, such as an executive order recognizing fetal personhood, but a Republican president might not need to go that far. One reason for that is the Comstock Act, a federal obscenity law passed in the 19th century. 
   
      Part of the Comstock Act, which was once best known for suppressing literature, sex education materials and even anatomy texts deemed to be obscene, seems to make it illegal to send via mail “[e]very article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.” 
   
      Under Biden, the Department of Justice recently released a definitive memo suggesting that mailing abortion pills is perfectly legal unless it is done with the intent of violating the law. But in a Republican administration, the DOJ could interpret the Comstock Act to apply to the mailing of every abortion pill and decide to aggressively enforce the law against those thought to violate it.  
   
      Despite the current DOJ’s interpretation of the law, anti-abortion groups are supporting local laws and bringing lawsuits suggesting that abortion pills are functionally illegal nationwide because of the Comstock Act. And neither telehealth nor in-clinic medication abortions would be possible if pills could not be mailed. 
   
      For the moment, this argument is doomed, but anti-abortion activists might not care. Their argument could succeed before a Supreme Court already transformed by one Republican president. Or a Republican DOJ in a future administration could change course.
   
      Control of the FDA can be as much of a gamechanger as power over the DOJ.   This has been true since the early days of abortion drugs’ approval in the United States, and the FDA now returns to center stage as more women and providers need access to medication abortions.  
   
      Meanwhile, anti-choice groups are getting creative in approaching the agency. Students for Life, a major anti-abortion group, has a petition before the FDA asking the agency to require any doctor prescribing abortion pills to be responsible for fetal remains — and to bag them and treat them as medical waste.  
 
      If Students for Life won, the new FDA rule could create insurmountable obstacles for abortion providers, who would have to monitor and dispose of medical waste in every procedure, including those done through telehealth. 
   
      The Alliance Defending Freedom, another major player in the anti-abortion movement, already went to court to ask federal judges to declare that the FDA exceeded its authority when it approved abortion pills. 
 
      Even a long shot may seem worth a try with the current ultraconservative Supreme Court, and besides, with a Republican in the White House, the FDA may change radically. 
   
      In 2020, a group of Republicans, led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, sent a letter to the FDA asking that abortion pills be pulled from the market. With a Republican in the White House, they just might get their wish.
   
      So, the latest FDA announcement may be much ado about relatively little. As far as access to abortion pills is concerned, this move must be contextualized withing the web of legal action, both at the state and federal level, which will continue to determine who can access abortion resources and who cannot. But in a different administration, both the DOJ and FDA might target abortion pills, and that means your vote for who sits in the White House matters more than you think.

      An ex-US Navy SEAL, who deserted the American military nearly four years ago, was killed fighting in Ukraine, according to the Navy. 
   
      Daniel W. Swift, who was a special warfare operator 1st class, was killed on Wednesday in Ukraine, the Navy said in a statement. Swift deserted the military on March 11, 2019.
   
      “We cannot speculate as to why the former Sailor was in Ukraine,” the Navy said.
   
      Swift had his Trident pin removed, a Navy official said, a severe step taken after a Trident Review Board determines a sailor no longer lives up to the requirements of being a Navy SEAL.
   
      The State Department confirmed the recent death of a US citizen fighting in Ukraine but offered no further details on the circumstances of death.
   
      “We are in touch with his family and providing all possible consular assistance,” a State Department spokesperson said. “Out of respect for the privacy of the family during this difficult time, we have nothing further to add.”
   
      Swift joined the Navy in 2005 and completed the Navy SEALS training in 2006, according to his service record provided by the Navy. During his time in the military, he earned awards and decorations for service in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   
      His record also contains an unexplained break in service from the beginning of 2014 to the end of 2015. His last assignment was a West Coast Special Warfare Unit, which started in August 2016.

      Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claims in his upcoming memoir that former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley plotted with former President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner to try to become Trump’s vice president, according to an excerpt of the book obtained by CNN.
   
      Pompeo, in his book “Never Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love,” takes several shots at potential 2024 Republican rivals, including Haley and former national security adviser John Bolton, as the onetime Kansas congressman and CIA director fuels speculation about his own presidential ambitions.
   
      Pompeo writes that he was told by John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff at the time, that Haley had scheduled a meeting with the president to discuss what she claimed was a personal matter and then came to the Oval Office meeting with Kushner and Ivanka Trump, who were serving as White House senior advisers.
   
      “As best Kelly could tell, they were presenting a possible ‘Haley for vice president’ option. I can’t confirm this, but he was certain he had been played, and he was not happy about it. Clearly, this visit did not reflect a team effort but undermined our work for America,” Pompeo writes in his book.
   
      CNN has reached out to Kelly for comment on Pompeo’s claim. 
   
      Haley refuted Pompeo’s allegations on Thursday, saying she “never had a conversation with Jared, Ivanka, or the president about the vice presidentship.”
   
      “Pompeo even says he’s not sure if it’s true,” the former South Carolina governor told Fox News, dismissing the claim as “gossip” and saying “there is no truth to it.”
   
      “What I’ll tell you is it’s really sad when you’re having to go out there and put lies and gossip to sell a book,” Haley said. “I don’t know why he said it but that’s exactly why I stayed out of DC as much as possible – to get away from the drama and get away from the gossip.
   
      But a White House source from that time has backed Pompeo’s claim, adding more context by recalling how Kushner and Ivanka Trump were pushing Haley to be secretary of state to succeed Rex Tillerson, who had objected to Kushner getting involved in foreign relations too often and in ways Tillerson disagreed with.
   
      But the president was not enamored with the idea and went with Pompeo, with whom he got along better and whom he liked more, the source said. 
   
      After that switch, Trump began talking negatively about his vice president, Mike Pence, who he thought was too often trying to convince him to back off controversial statements or actions. Kushner and Ivanka Trump began pushing Haley again, the source said. Kelly tried to talk the president out of it, arguing that Pence had helped win him the support of evangelical Christian voters in 2016. Kelly was surprised, the source said, that Pence lasted through the 2020 election.
   
      Pompeo, whose book will be published next week, is also scathing in his assessment of Bolton, who has said he may launch a presidential bid to stop Trump from getting a second term in office.
   
      Pompeo takes issue with Bolton’s 2020 book “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir” and claims the former Trump national security adviser divulged classified information and should be prosecuted.
   
      “His self-serving stories contained classified information and deeply sensitive details about conversations involving a sitting commander in chief,” Pompeo writes. “That’s the very definition of treason.”
   
      “John Bolton should be in jail for spilling classified information. I hope I can one day testify at a criminal trial as a witness for the prosecution,” Pompeo writes.
   
      When Bolton wrote the book, there was significant controversy over security reviews of the book before it was published. 
   
      “My book was fully cleared in the prepublication review process conducted by the cognizant career NSC Senior Director, whose home agency was the National Archives,” Bolton told CNN in response to Pompeo’s claims. 
   
      “Pompeo’s comments tell you more about his character than about my book,” he added.
   
      Trump remains the only declared candidate in the 2024 presidential election, but several Republicans have signaled they could jump into the race. CNN has reported that President Joe Biden plans to launch his reelection campaign sometime after his State of the Union address, which is scheduled for February 7.

      Here’s some “tough news” for premium travelers whose New Year’s resolution was healthier meals: Desserts are back.  
   
      After a pandemic pause, the signature treats are returning to premium cabins at United Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
   
      The offerings include Delta’s dessert cart and United’s sundae cart. They’re available only on international flights in the highest class of service – among other ritzy amenities such as lie-flat seats and plush premium bedding.
   
      United’s sundae cart is the cherry on top of its Polaris business class on long-haul international flights.  The airline said the service is currently available on some flights out of San Francisco and expands in February.   
   
      Delta’s “trolley of treats” includes ice cream, too – and “toppings like whipped cream, cookie crumble, fruit compote and chocolate chips.”  
   
      A perk of some international flights in the upscale Delta One cabin, other tasty options include cake, cheese and fruit.   
   
      US airlines dialed back various services during the pandemic – cutting expenses when planes were flying at a financial loss and exposing flight attendants to fewer in-person interactions. 
   
      United, for example, said the sundae cart was replaced by packaged, single-serve ice cream.   
   
      But while passengers have returned to domestic flights, airlines are still working to draw passengers back to international routes.  International travel in 2020 was 23% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels – a difference of 58 million travelers – according to government data compiled by the air carrier industry group Airlines for America.   
   
      The group’s figures show corporate travel – paid for by companies that can shell out several thousand dollars for a first-class overseas seat – is down but growing.   
   
      United said selling international seats is particularly challenging in its premium cabin, where the ice cream cart is set to roll.  But a return in corporate travelers will help because “that is how we tend to fill the front of the aircraft.”  
   
      “Polaris is not back to where we’d like it to be just yet,” Andrew Nocella, United’s chief commercial officer, told investors on a call this month.   
   
      “I’m confident when we end 2023, we’ll be able to report that the Polaris paid load factors and paid yield are much closer to their 2019 baseline than they were in 2022,” he said.  
   
      Delta, meanwhile, is expanding its premium seating and plans to have the upgrade on 84% of its large international planes this summer.  
   
      CEO Ed Bastian told investors on its own call this month to expect more Delta trans-Atlantic capacity than flew in 2019.  The airline also said it sold more dollars worth of premium seats in December 2022 than in December 2019. 
   
      And that was before Delta rolls out the espresso martinis and chocolate chip cookies.

      Legendary rocker Neil Young has paid tribute to former Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young bandmate David Crosby. 
   
      “David is gone, but his music lives on. The soul of CSNY, David’s voice and energy were at the heart of our band,” the statement, posted to Young’s website, read. 
   
      Crosby’s family announced Thursday that he died at age 81. 
   
      “His great songs stood for what we believed in and it was always fun and exciting when we got to play together,” Young’s tribute continued. “We had so many great times, especially in the early years. Crosby was a very supportive friend in my early life, as we bit off big pieces of our experience together. David was the catalyst of many things.” 
   
      Young concluded, “thanks David for your spirit and songs, Love you man. I remember the best times!” 
   
      Young and Crosby’s paths crossed in 1970 when Young joined Crosby, Stills & Nash. The supergroup then became known as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and went on to release “Déjà Vu,” which contained the hit song “Woodstock.”
   
      The rock pioneers weren’t always on the same page, despite the many stages they shared. 
   
      “When you meet, when you start a band, you’re in love with each other,” Crosby told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in 2019. “Forty years later, when you’ve done it for forty years and it’s devolved to just turn on the smoke machine and play your hits, it’s not musically exciting, it’s not fun and we weren’t friends.” 
   
      Amanpour posed the question of Crosby possibly repairing his friendship with his former CSNY bandmates, to which Crosby replied: “That I would like to do.” 
   
      Stephen Stills and Graham Nash also paid tribute to Crosby. 
   
      “It is only the memory of such a unique and full life so well lived that must sustain us through this period of profound grief,” Stills shared in a statement.
   
      Stills added that “David lived a life of deep and enduring gratitude and was an extraordinary, richly sentient being,” continuing to say that “his music will live on through us all.”
   
      Nash reflected on their at-times “volatile” relationship in a tribute posted to Facebook, adding that “what has always mattered to David and me more than anything was the pure joy of the music we created together.”

But that doesn't mean they're finding bargains at their local dealerships.,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/19/business/new-car-prices/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230119111448-new-car-prices-file-110322.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-01-19T13:28:57Z,"
      Americans can once again buy cars for less than sticker price. But that doesn’t mean they’re finding bargains at their local dealerships.
   
      A year ago, record tight inventories meant 80% of buyers were paying more than the manufacturers’ suggested retail price (MSRP), or sticker price, according to data from Edmunds. For decades, car buyers had been able to negotiate a discount.
   
      Today, only 36% of buyers are paying above sticker. After paying an average of $700 above MSRP in the spring, buyers paid an average of $300 less than sticker in December.
   
      That’s still far less than the $2,600 average that buyers saved on the sticker price in 2019, according to Edmunds’ data — while the average transaction price remains at a record high, according to data from both Edmunds and Cox Automotive, which both track car sales, prices and inventories. 
   
      That put the average transaction price at just under $50,000 in December, up about $10,000, or 26%, from December 2019, just before the pandemic upended the new car market.
   
      The auto industry’s inventory shortage, which began in early 2021, was driven by a lack of parts, most notably computer chips. That crunch meant cars and trucks were being sold even before they arrived at dealerships — so if someone didn’t want to pay above sticker, there was no shortage of buyers who would. 
   
      The inventory of parts, and new cars, has since started to improve. Car dealer lots are fuller than a year ago — Cox estimates the supply of new cars has increased by 800,000, or 83%, from the start of 2022 — but that’s still more than 1 million vehicles below historical inventory levels.
   
      Automakers have concentrated on using the increased supply of chips and other parts to build their more expensive — and more profitable — models, such as large SUVs and pickups and hot new EVs, which come with a high sticker price of their own (,as well as a wait list for buyers). 
   
      Cheaper models, such as compact sedans, are still in very short supply, especially since General Motors, Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis have more or less pulled out of those markets. Asian automakers that still make the cheaper car models also have some of the tightest inventories.
   
      “Just try to find a Civic,” said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for Cox.
   
      Even if buyers are paying less than sticker today, they’re also getting less for the cars they’re trading in, as the value of used cars has fallen sharply in the last six months. 
   
      Without the tighter inventories that drove new car buyers into the used car market, prices for used cars have fallen by about 9% over the past year, according to the Consumer Price Index, the government’s key inflation measure. Prices for vehicles five or more years old are down about 15%, according to data from Edmunds. That means the value of trade-ins has dropped by about $3,000, or 11%, just since the peak in June.
   
      In addition, interest rates have risen sharply as the Federal Reserve has hiked rates in an effort to bring inflation under control, and buyers are having to fork out record-high car payments, including the longest loan terms on record, to drive cars off the lots.
   
      There are signs that things will get better for new car buyers in the months ahead as inventories continue to build. That will give buyers more chances to haggle once again. Incentives offered to attract buyers, which had virtually vanished, are rising once again, according to the data. 
   
      “Inventory is on an upward trajectory. That opens up for some price easing,” said Zack Krelle, industry analyst at TrueCar.
   
      Unfortunately, the biggest thing that could help prices could be a downturn for the economy, with a rise in job losses and unemployment. That would likely take a large bite out of demand, and help to push prices down. But prices may not drop as much as in past recessions, given the pent-up demand of buyers who have stayed on the sidelines for the last few years waiting for the chance to buy, according to Krelle.

      David Adams spent half a decade fighting an illness he couldn’t name. He was in and out of the hospital several times per year. His inflamed joints made his hands feel like they had been squeezed into gloves – and he could no longer play his beloved classical and jazz guitars. 
   
      He had constant fevers and fatigue. He even developed pain and swelling in his genitalia, which was his first sign that something was really wrong.
   
      “At the turn of the year 2016, I started with some really painful effects in the male anatomy,” said Adams, now 70. “After that, again, a lot of fatigue – my primary care physician at that point had blood tests done, and my white blood cell count was very, very low.”
   
      Next, Adams, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia, saw a hematologist, a pulmonologist, a urologist, a rheumatologist and then a dermatologist. Some of them thought he might have cancer. 
   
      Adams’ symptoms continued, with even more fatigue, pneumonia and a large rash below his waist. He tried at least a dozen medications, saw about two dozen doctors, and nothing helped. 
   
      In 2019, worsening symptoms forced him to retire early from his decades-long career in clinical data systems. But he remained in the dark about what was causing the problems.
   
      Finally, in 2020, scientists at the National Institutes of Health discovered and named a rare genetic disorder: VEXAS syndrome, which wreaks havoc on the body through inflammation and blood problems. 
   
      Adams had an appointment with his rheumatologist at the time, and when he walked into the office, he saw that his physician “was giddy like a little kid.”
   
      In his doctor’s hands was a copy of a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine detailing the discovery of VEXAS syndrome.
   
      Adams had his answer. 
   
      “For the first time, there was a one-to-one correlation of symptoms,” he said. “It was quite a shock.”
   
      An estimated 1 in about 13,500 people in the United States may have VEXAS syndrome, a new study suggests, which means the mysterious and sometimes deadly inflammatory disorder may be more common than previously thought.
   
      In comparison, the genetic disorder spinal muscular atrophy affects about 1 in 10,000 people and Huntington’s disease occurs in about 1 in every 10,000 to 20,000 people.
   
      Since its discovery, occasional VEXAS cases have been reported in medical research, but the study reveals new estimates of its prevalence.
   
      The research, published Tuesday in the journal JAMA, suggests that about 1 in 13,591 people in the US have mutations in the UBA1 gene, which develop later in life and cause VEXAS syndrome. 
   
      “This study is demonstrating that there’s likely tens of thousands of patients in the US that have this disease, and the vast majority of them are probably not being recognized because physicians aren’t really considering this as a diagnosis more broadly,” said Dr. David Beck, an assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU Langone Health and a lead author of the study.
   
      VEXAS syndrome is not inherited, so people who have it don’t pass the disease to their children. But the UBA1 gene is on the X chromosome, so the syndrome is an X-linked disease. It predominantly affects men, who carry only one X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, so if they have a mutation in a gene on one X chromosome but not the other, they are generally unaffected.
   
      “It’s present in 1 in 4,000 men over the age of 50. So we think it’s a disease that should be thought about in terms of testing for individuals that have the symptoms,” said Beck, who also led the federal research team that identified the shared UBA1 mutation among VEXAS patients in 2020.
   
      “The benefit of VEXAS syndrome is that we have a test. We have a genetic test that can help directly provide the diagnosis,” he said. “It’s just a question of patients who meet the criteria – who are older individuals with systemic inflammation, low blood counts, who really aren’t responding to anything but steroids – then advocating to their doctors to get genetic testing to get a diagnosis.”
   
      Adams, who became a patient of Beck’s, said that finally getting a diagnosis – and understanding the cause of his symptoms – was life-changing.
   
      “It really was incredibly freeing to have the diagnosis,” he said. 
   
      “You can’t fight your enemy unless your enemy has a name,” he added. “We finally had something where we could point to and say, ‘OK, we understand what’s going on. This is VEXAS.’ “
   
      For the new study, Beck and his colleagues at the NIH, New York University, Geisinger Research and other institutions analyzed data on 163,096 patients in a health system in central and northeastern Pennsylvania, from January 1996 to January 2022, including electronic health records and blood samples. 
   
      Eleven of the patients had a disease-causing UBA1 variant, and a 12th person had a “highly suspicious” variant. 
   
      Only three of the 12 are still alive. A five-year survival rate of 63% has been previously reported with VEXAS.
   
      Among the 11 patients in the new study who had pathogenic variants in UBA1, only two were women. Seven had arthritis as a symptom, and four had been diagnosed with rheumatologic diseases, such as psoriasis of the skin or sarcoidosis, which causes swollen lumps in the body. All had anemia or low blood cell counts.
   
      “None had been previously clinically diagnosed with VEXAS syndrome,” Beck said.
   
      The finding “is emphasizing how it’s important to be able to pick these patients out, give them the diagnosis and start the aggressive therapies or aggressive treatments to keep their inflammation in check,” he said.
   
      VEXAS – an acronym for five clinical characteristics of the disease – has no standardized treatment or cure, but Beck said symptoms can be managed with medications like the steroid prednisone or other immunosuppressants. 
   
      “But the toxicities of prednisone over years is challenging. There are other anti-inflammatory medications that we use, but they’re only partially effective at the moment,” he said. “One treatment for individuals that we’ve seen that’s very effective is bone marrow transplantation. That comes with its own risks, but that’s just underscoring the severe nature of the disease.”
   
      Although the new study helps provide estimates of the prevalence and symptoms of VEXAS syndrome, the data is not representative of the entire United States, and Beck said that more research needs to be done on a larger, more diverse group of people.
   
      Some men might be hesitant to seek medical care for VEXAS symptoms, but Adams said that doing so could save their life.
   
      “Eventually, it’s going to get so bad that you’ll end up like my first hospitalization, where you’re on death’s door,” Adams said. “You don’t want to be in that situation.”
   
      Adams has been taking prednisone to ease his symptoms, and it’s helped. But because steroid use can have side effects such as cataracts and weight gain, he has been working with his doctors to find other therapies so he can reduce his intake of the medication.
   
      Beck and his colleagues are studying targeted therapies for VEXAS syndrome, as well as conducting stem cell bone marrow transplant trials at the NIH.
   
      “There are many different facets of the disease,” Dr. Bhavisha Patel, a hematologist and researcher in the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute’s Hematopoiesis and Bone Marrow Failure Laboratory, said in an NIH news release last month.
 
      “I believe that is what is challenging when we think about treatment, because it’s so heterogeneous,” said Patel, who was not involved in the new study.
   
      “Both at NIH and worldwide, the groups that have dedicated themselves to VEXAS are looking for medical therapies to offer to other patients who don’t qualify for a bone marrow transplant,” she said. “We continue to collaborate on many projects in order to categorize this disease further and ultimately come up with the best treatment options.”

      In the past month, the media circus surrounding US Rep. George Santos, elected last November to Congress to represent a district in northeastern Queens and part of Long Island’s Nassau County, has dragged an increasingly-stunned American public through an ever-disentangling web of lies and intrigue. Much of how Santos presented himself during his 2020 run for office — his background, identity and qualifications for serving in government, among other details — has been proven false or, at best, dubious. His campaign’s finances are now also in the spotlight.
   
      In addition to the incredible fabrications Santos wove, it has emerged that he allegedly embezzled a shop clerk in Brazil using a stolen checkbook in 2008. (Brazilian authorities are planning to reinstate fraud charges after their investigation was canceled in 2013 because they couldn’t locate Santos.) He also allegedly kept $3,000 from a GoFundMe intended to raise money for surgery for a homeless US Navy veteran’s dog, and even stole a scarf from a friend — which somehow feels like the lowest of the low. 
   
      In response to reporting on the GoFundMe controversy, Santos told CNN he had “no clue” what his accuser was referring to, and claimed he’d had “dozens of people reaching out to me in support sharing their stories about their dogs and cats that I help save and rescue.” He has also denied committing any crimes, including fraud or theft, while acknowledging that he had fabricated some portions of his work, education and family history both during his political campaign and adult life more broadly.
   
      Amid this hotbed of falsehoods and egregious behavior, one fishy story has broken through in particular: Santos’ alleged past as a drag performer. Journalist Marisa Kabas first broke the news of Santos’ apparent dabbling in drag while living in a suburb of Rio de Janeiro — revealing an image sourced from a former friend and fellow drag queen, Eula Rochard — of Santos performing under the name Kitara Rivache. Kabas’ scoop has been furthered by frothy reporting in both US and Brazilian tabloids. This week, Business Insider reported that Santos’ drag career spanned a number of years. 
   
      Santos has largely rebutted these characterizations of his past, acknowledging only of the apparent photo/video evidence that he “was young and had fun at a festival. Sue me for having a life!” 
   
      In the words of another American political liar, “Sad!”
   
      But let’s be clear: it’s not sad that Santos was a drag queen. Rather, it’s sad that so many Americans seem to care more about (and revel more in) trashing Santos for expressing his gender diversity than the plethora of potentially criminally offensive lies he has peddled. Thanks to those lies, he now sits on two congressional committees. That’s the real travesty.
   
      Look, we all love a good hypocrisy-bites-back story and an unexpected plot twist — Santos positioning himself as both an openly gay and anti-LGBTQ (he has spoken out in support of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ “Don’t Say Gay” bill, for example) politician sure fits that bill. In this sense, there is certainly the appeal for even those who consider themselves LGBTQ allies to cling to scandalous headlines and blurry Pride parade photos. Some among the LGBTQ community, meanwhile, have taken the opportunity to critique the standard of Santos’ drag.
   
      Still, the overblown reaction to this part of Santos’ past is not at all surprising. It’s right in line with America’s witch hunt for people who don’t fit “CisHet” (cisgender and heterosexual) norms, as evidenced by the dangerous moral panic currently raging over drag queens and transgender people. 
   
      Gov. DeSantis this past week asked for information on the number of Florida university students who identify as transgender — for reasons currently unknown, but certainly ominous — and has recently justified his ban on an advanced-placement African American Studies program being taught in the state because of its alleged inclusion of queer theory, among other reasons. That follows a number of states’ pelting assault on trans youth, their families and medical providers and a chilling bill just introduced in West Virginia that would make “exposing children” to transgender people a crime. 
   
      These are just a few of the dozens, potentially soon to be hundreds, of bills getting introduced aimed at stripping LGBTQ people of our rights. And that’s not to mention the wave of protests at perfectly innocent drag queen story hours around the country, including protests in Queens just a few short miles from Santos’ district. 
   
      That we’re so distracted by the sass and sparkle of drag we can’t seem to focus on the things that are actually important — like, say, our crumbling infrastructure, climate crisis, the Ukraine war and inflation — is disheartening to say the least. 
   
      Drag is an important part of queer culture and, today, even mainstream pop culture, as evidenced by the popularity of shows like “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” Many would even argue, as an artform, that drag is inherently political — but it is not a political crisis and should not be judged by the morality police.
   
      Still, it feels as if there have been as many headlines about Santos’ drag days as there have about his apparent lies about his mother’s presence in the World Trade Center’s South Tower on 9/11, and earlier coverage revealing he’d lied about his grandparents being Holocaust survivors. 
   
      That is incredibly problematic, and plays right into the hands of the far-right. I get that it’s easier to kvetch about a queer person caked in makeup and lip-syncing to Madonna than about carbon emissions or the price of eggs, but we have a broken health care system. Focus, people! 
   
      The frivolous fixation on this part of Santos’ life is the perfect microcosm for how our country is so easily distracted by LGBTQ culture wars, many of which are deliberately drawn out and sensationalized to avoid us all focusing on the bigger picture. Democrats and sane Republicans ought to be putting this conversation to bed. Santos has enough legitimate grievances against him and there is no need to further stigmatize the LGBTQ community. 
   
      In a twist of sheer irony, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said he’s standing by Santos for now. That, sadly, may be the closest we ever get to the far-right embracing LGBTQ people. But I wonder if McCarthy would go along for the ride if Santos suggested leading a drag story hour at his local library — or, why not? On the House floor! I’d highly recommend Alicia Ortego’s children’s book, “Honesty is my Superpower,” as a read to kick off with. 
   
      Perhaps one day, we’ll send an out-and-proud drag queen to Washington, unabashed in who she is and brutally honest about her journey. By then, I hope her identity is a point of celebration rather than contention. 
   
      Once there, let’s hope she’ll simply say, “Honey, move over, I’m signing onto that healthcare reform bill,” and, like a wig snatched to reveal another wig underneath, her opponents won’t even know what hit them.

      The suspect in the Half Moon Bay, California, mass shooting was charged Wednesday with seven counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in what became the deadliest attack in San Mateo County’s history, the district attorney said.
   
      “This one is in a category that is way beyond anything we’ve ever dealt with,” San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said. “I’m sorry that we have joined the list of counties around this country that have had to deal with this.” 
   
      The suspect – identified as 66-year-old Chunli Zhao –  is charged with shooting four people at a mushroom farm Monday, where the suspect was an employee, and three more were killed at a nearby farm, authorities said. The suspect was a “coworker or former coworker” of the victims at each shooting site and evidence points to the attack being an instance of workplace violence, San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus said.
   
      As the investigation continues, the Half Moon Bay community’s sense of peace was left “destroyed by senseless death,” California Assembly member Marc Berman said, noting that there are workplace disagreements and relationship disagreements happen all over the world.
   
      “But it’s only in the United States where far too often those disagreements end in mass shootings,” Berman added, promising that the state will do everything possible to further reduce such incidents.
   
      The attack marked the second mass shooting California suffered in just 48 hours. It came as investigators to the south were still piecing together what led up to a mass shooting in Monterey Park, California, where 11 people were killed Saturday night.
   
      Meanwhile, new details emerged in the Yakima, Washington, shooting that killed three people at or near a Circle K convenience store less than a day after the shooting in Half Moon Bay. Court documents revealed Wednesday that the shooting suspect’s mother called police in the hours after the attack, saying she believed her son was involved in the shooting.
   
      Here are some other key developments from the recent shootings:
   
      “Only in America do we see this kind of carnage, this kind of chaos, this kind of disruption of communities and lives,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday, calling for federal action on gun safety laws.
   
      There have been more mass shootings in the United States than there have been days this year.
   
      Forty mass shootings have been recorded in the US in 2023 – more than at this point in any year on record, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
   
      As communities marked by acts of gun violence continue to grieve the lives lost, investigators on the different cases have been working to establish motives behind the attacks. Here are more details of some of the recent shootings.
   
      Authorities still don’t know what motivated the Saturday night shooting at Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park, and investigators have so far not been able to establish a connection between the suspect and any of the victims – including any romantic connection, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna announced Wednesday.
   
      Investigators also do not believe the suspect – identified as 72-year-old Huu Can Tran – has frequented the dance studio in the last five years, Luna said. Three people who knew Tran, including his ex-wife, previously told CNN he had once been a familiar face at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio, where he gave informal dance lessons. 
   
      “Sometimes it’s frustrating when something like this happens. It’s so tragic because we’re trying to understand it and it doesn’t make sense. It really doesn’t,” the sheriff added, explaining that investigators are working to find a motive.
   
      The gunman fired 42 rounds from a semi-automatic handgun at the dance hall before heading to a second dance studio in nearby Alhambra, where a civilian charged him and wrestled the gun away from him, Luna said. 
   
      The firearm – which sources say was then used to identify the suspect – is believed to have been the murder weapon, Luna said. The gun was not registered in the state of California, but was purchased by the suspect in 1999 in Monterey Park, the sheriff added.
   
      On Wednesday, officers recovered a motorcycle registered to the suspect just one block away from the scene of the shooting in Monterey Park, the sheriff announced.
   
      “Homicide investigators determined that the motorcycle was parked there sometime on Saturday, just prior to the mass murder,” Luna said. “Investigators believe it was placed there by the suspect as an alternative getaway vehicle.”
   
      Less than a day after the shooting, Tran was found dead inside a white van about 30 miles away in Torrance. He died following a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the sheriff previously said.
   
      The shooting at the dance studio killed 11 people and wounded nine others.
   
      Those killed were identified by the coroner’s office as: Xiujuan Yu, 57; Hongying Jian, 62; Lilan Li, 63; Mymy Nhan, 65; Muoi Dai Ung, 67; and Diana Man Ling Tom, 70; Wen-Tau Yu, 64; Valentino Marcos Alvero, 68; Ming Wei Ma, 72; Yu-Lun Kao, 72; and Chia Ling Yau, 76.
   
      After the attack, investigators served a search warrant at the home of the suspected gunman and found “hundreds of rounds” of ammunition as well as evidence leading officials to believe he was “manufacturing homemade firearm suppressors,” Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said.
   
      Authorities on Wednesday identified those killed in the Half Moon Bay shooting as: Yetao Bing, 43, Qizhong Cheng, 66, Marciano Martinez Jimenez, 50, Aixiang Zhang, 74, Jingzhi Lu, 64, and Zhishen Liu, 73.
   
      Speaking from Half Moon Bay on Tuesday, Newsom said the victims are dealing with a “myriad of issues” at the same time, describing speaking to people at the hospital who seemed more worried about the cost of healthcare bills or about losing their jobs because they can’t work.  
   
      “The stories are devastating,” Newsom said. 
   
      Zhao made his first courtroom appearance Wednesday but did not enter a plea. He is scheduled to be arraigned on February 16.
   
      In addition to murder charges, Zhao also faces enhancements for the use of a firearm, great bodily injury, and multiple murder, according to District Attorney Wagstaffe.  
   
      Zhao had previously been accused of trying to suffocate and threatening to kill a former coworker at another job nearly a decade ago, according to court records obtained by CNN, which show he was subject to a temporary restraining order after the alleged attack in 2013.
   
      Court documents filed by the Yakima Police Department revealed new details Wednesday on the fatal shootings. 
   
      The suspect, identified as 21-year-old Jarid Haddock, visited the Circle K store around 3 a.m. and walked around for about 40 seconds without interacting with anyone or buying anything, according to investigators who reviewed surveillance video, the court documents said. 
   
      He returned 30 minutes later, this time with a gun, the document says.
   
      The suspect pointed the gun at a man and woman and fired several shots at them as he moved in their direction, law enforcement said, adding that “based on the video, it appeared Jarid fired all of the rounds from his magazine.”
   
      He then dropped the magazine from the gun and reached into his bag for another and approached the victims again who were on the floor, officials said. Based on the video, the woman was still alive “since her arm was moving” and the gunman stood over the woman and fired “several more shots at her,” the court documents said.
   
      After the suspect left the store, he ran to the gas pumps and approached a Chevrolet Tahoe and “fired approximately six shots into the driver’s side window,” striking the driver, the court documents revealed. 
   
      According to the documents, Haddock’s mother called the police after 7 a.m. and said she mbelieved her son was involved in the shooting.  
   
      The mother told police that Haddock “had been using methamphetamine for approximately three years,” but it was getting worse over the last month and that he had access to several firearms in a safe at home – including one similar to an “AK-47 that could kill a lot of people,” the court documents said.  
   
      Police were eventually pointed to the suspect’s location after a woman who had lent the suspect her phone heard him make “several incriminating statements including ‘I killed those people,’” Murray said during a news conference.
   
      The suspect later died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police.

      Today, due largely to the mounting dangers of Russia’s reckless invasion of Ukraine, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board moved the hands of the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight than they’ve ever been. It marks the first change in three years to the Clock’s time; it now stands at 90 seconds to midnight.
   
      Never in the Doomsday Clock’s 76-year history have we been so close to global catastrophe.  
   
      Founded by Albert Einstein and University of Chicago scientists who developed the first atomic weapons, the Clock is a universally recognized indicator of the world’s profound vulnerability to nuclear weapons, climate change and disruptive technologies. The closer to midnight the Clock is set, the greater the existential danger.  
   
      As the war in Ukraine veers toward its second year, the world finds itself in a most perilous moment. Tens of thousands of people, many innocent civilians, have been killed. No obvious solution to the conflict is in sight.
   
      This stands in stark contrast to the goodwill and mutual understanding that followed the fall of the Soviet Union, when Russia joined the US and Great Britain and solemnly declared they would “respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine” and “refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.” An historic deal was made. In return, Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal — then the third largest in the world — and became a signatory to the landmark Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
   
      Russia brazenly violated its commitments in 2014 when it invaded eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Now, it has launched a full-scale military invasion of the country, with Russian President Vladimir Putin even threatening the use of nuclear weapons. These unprecedented threats — in the context of a brutal and unpredictable war — raise the terrifying possibility nuclear weapons will be used for the first time since 1945, either by accident, some miscalculation or even a deliberate decision from Putin himself. 
   
      Disturbingly, Russia has brought its war even to the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactor sites, violating international protocols and risking the widespread release of radioactive materials. Efforts by the International Atomic Energy Agency to secure the plants have so far been rebuffed and the threat of disaster remains. 
   
      Underscoring the heightened danger, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres recently warned the world is now entering “a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.” He was speaking at a UN conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, now undermined as a result of Russia breaking its pledge to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty. 
   
      The sole remaining nuclear weapons treaty between the US and Russia, New START, is also in jeopardy. Unless the two parties resume negotiations and find a solid basis for further arms reductions, the treaty will expire in 2026. This would then eliminate current mutual inspections, end limits on nuclear deployments and likely spur an unpredictable and unstable nuclear arms race amid the development of ever more advanced weapons. This will further deepen mistrust, perhaps irreversibly, and increase the likelihood of nuclear war. 
   
      While these threats are immediate and horrific, there are others. Countries in both Asia and the Middle East are talking about building nuclear arsenals. Tensions are escalating between the US and China. 
   
      At the same time, the world is increasing its use of fossil fuels and spewing heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Covid-19 is still killing huge numbers of people and mutating in dangerous new ways — with future pandemics a near certainty. As science advances, so too do the threats, both in biosecurity and disruptive technologies. 
   
      If there was ever a time for world leaders to take actions to turn back the Clock, it’s now. Until then, it is 90 seconds to midnight.

      The Dallas Zoo is working with the Dallas Police Department to increase security on the zoo campus following a string of incidents involving several animals and enclosures, zoo officials said.
   
      “On Saturday morning, the animal care team discovered one of our lappet-faced vultures dead in its habitat,” zoo President and CEO Gregg Hudson said during a news conference Monday.
   
      Hudson said “an unusual wound and injuries” were found, which indicated the vulture, Pin, did not die of natural causes.
   
      “Given the recent events that have happened here at the zoo, the clouded leopard in particular, from last Friday, and the suspicious nature of this animal’s death,” the zoo alerted police.
   
      Since the first incidents occurred 11 days ago, the zoo has expanded security camera coverage, it has more than doubled its overnight security presence, it has increased the amount of overnight staff, and it has limited the abilities of some of the animals to go outside overnight, Hudson said.
   
      The Dallas Zoo announced it is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and indictment of a suspect.
   
      Dallas police spokesperson Kristin Lowman noted police are working with US Fish and Wildlife on the investigations.
   
      This is the third incident at the zoo in less than two weeks.
   
      On Friday, January 13, zoo staff discovered a clouded leopard, Nova, had escaped her habitat after a section of fencing had been cut. The zoo was closed as officials searched for her.
   
      Nova was discovered safe that night on zoo grounds, but over the course of the search, zoo personnel found the langur monkey enclosure had also been tampered with. All the langurs were present in the enclosure and none had been injured.
   
      Lowman said part of the ongoing investigations is to determine whether the enclosure tampering incidents are related to Pin’s death.

      Mummies tend to spark feelings of the uncanny because they hover on an uncomfortable line between living and dead, between human and object. 
   
      “I don’t know if you’ve seen that mummy,” former President Bill Clinton once tastelessly joked about a 500-year-old mummified Peruvian girl nicknamed Juanita. “But you know, if I were a single man, I might ask that mummy out. That’s a good-looking mummy.”
   
      Objectifying mummies has long been a concern, though rarely in quite that way. A bigger problem is the tendency to treat mummies as objects, an exploitable commodity for industry or entertainment.
   
      Over the past few years, museums have started changing the way they talk about mummies, replacing the term “mummy” with “mummified person,” “mummified remains,” or other descriptors as a way of treating human remains with greater dignity and respect. 
   
      The issue came to the fore this week when a British tabloid accused a number of museums of going “woke” by changing their language. As the British Museum noted in a statement to CNN, the change isn’t a total ban on the word “mummy,” which is still used in the museum’s galleries. 
   
      Nevertheless, a spate of online headlines cast the changes as a ban on “mummy.” Since every effort at sensitivity is culture-war fodder, the conversation quickly turned into an argument about going “woke” instead of centering on the real issue: how we should talk about, and whether we should display, human bodies. 
   
      The display of human bodies or body parts has a long history. Sometimes it was a sign of reverence. The Inca, for example, treated the mummified bodies of their important dead as though they were alive, dressing them and presenting them with food. 
   
      The Catholic Church has filled cathedrals with the bodies and body parts of saints, which they consider holy relics fit for public viewing. 
   
      Other times the display is intentionally dehumanizing. Many a ruler has set the heads of enemies on spikes, and even into the early modern era, Western countries left the decaying bodies of executed criminals on public display as a warning and a show of power. 
   
      In English, use of the word “mummy” to mean a preserved human body dates back about 400 years, borrowed from the Latin version of an Arabic word. 
   
      But from the beginning the word was intended to put distance between the living and the dead, to turn deceased humans into objects.
   
      Before it meant a whole corpse, “mummy” was first used to describe the oils and other preservatives used to embalm Egyptian bodies. 
   
      A lively trade in bodies from the 15th century on saw thousands of mummies exported from Egypt to Europe where they were ground up to make everything from medicine to paint to fertilizer. Many falsely believed that when consumed from a corpse, these substances had special powers.
   
      A merchant supplying bodies for this mummy trade is on record wondering how “Christians, so dainty-mouthed, could eat the bodies of the dead.” The answer is that they didn’t really think of mummies as people.
   
      Our language, reflecting Christian ideas of the immortal soul, traditionally recognizes at least a degree of distinction between the person and the flesh. After all, when we cremate a body, we don’t speak of the ashes as a “person experiencing cremation.” 
   
      But what does it mean to think of the body as synonymous with the person, versus thinking of the body as a vessel for the soul? 
   
      Perhaps one reason that the minor change in language to describe mummification sparked so much interest is because it subtly rejects the religious view of a person’s essence residing in their soul and instead suggests that we are but bone and sinew. 
   
      Another reason is less ethereal. Many human remains, whether skeletal or mummified, found in Western museums came there due to the legacy of imperialism and colonialism. Many bodies put on display are those of Black, Brown, and Indigenous people, or are ancient enough to seem culturally distinct from modern populations. They didn’t choose to be there. 
   
      Displays of other cultures’ dead are therefore expressions of racial and cultural power dynamics, and our language reflects that. They aren’t “us.” Many will refer to the preserved body of an indigenous ruler as a “mummy.” But the preserved corpse on display in Moscow is usually called Vladimir Lenin, not “the mummy of a Russian leader.” 
   
      In the United States, museums, universities and other government institutions still warehouse more than 110,000 Native American bodies. Loud opposition meets any attempt to repatriate remains, often framed in culture-war terms. In the UK, the British Museum alone holds more than 6,000 human remains. The British Museum says that visitors “expect to see human remains as an element of our Museum displays.”
   
      But should we? 
   
      Making a few cosmetic changes to signage to acknowledge the dead as people is a good start. 
   
      But real change will only come when we honor the dead by getting them out of our museums and leaving them to rest as they, their descendants, and their cultures wished.

      Even as rents continue to climb across the country, renting is still cheaper than monthly payments for a purchased home in 45 of the 50 largest US cities in December, according to a report from Realtor.com. Renting costs nearly $800 less per month than buying, on average. 
   
      But there are five cities where, despite stubbornly high prices, rising mortgage rates and some of the least affordable home buying conditions in decades, it is still cheaper to buy than to rent.
   
      Rent is still going up, but steadily slowed its pace of growth throughout 2022. The national median rent jumped 3.2% in December from a year ago, marking the eleventh month of slowing rent growth from January’s peak of 17.4% growth, according to the report, released on Thursday. 
   
      Following four months of declines, median asking rent flattened out in December at $1,712 per month. That’s down by $69 per month from the peak in July 2022, but is still $308 higher than December 2019. It also represents an increase of 21.9% from pre-pandemic levels.
   
      A year ago, as rents were spiking but mortgage rates had not surged, it was more affordable to buy in many cities than to rent. 
   
      But with mortgage rates double where they were a year ago, monthly costs to own a home have created a widening gap between rents and payments made by first-time homebuyers. Homeownership costs grew 37.4% in December 2022 from the year before. That was more than 10 times faster than rents, which were up 3.2% during the same period. 
   
      During the first half of 2022, as mortgage rates surged, several cities flipped from being favorable to buyers to being more favorable to renters, including Atlanta; Baltimore; Charlotte, North Carolina; Cleveland; Hartford, Connecticut; Indianapolis; Philadelphia; Miami; and Orlando, Jacksonville and Tampa, Florida.
   
      Baltimore is the only city that flipped back to being a place where it is more favorable to buy in December 2022. 
   
      Now, just five markets of the top 50 cities favor homeownership over renting in December. 
   
      Memphis, Tennessee, had the biggest savings to homebuyers over renters, with the monthly cost of homeownership 32.7% less than renting. It was followed by Pittsburgh; Birmingham, Alabama; St. Louis and Baltimore. Monthly buying costs assume a 7% down payment with a mortgage rate of 6.36%, and include taxes, insurance and homeowners association fees.
   
      The amount saved by purchasing a home in these cities has decreased from last year, as stubbornly high prices and elevated mortgage rates eat away at the financial payoff to buying. 
   
      Deciding whether to rent or buy ultimately depends on personal circumstances, including location, financial situation and how long one plans to live in the home. Generally, it is not in your financial interest to buy if you plan to live in your home less than a few years, and a common rule of thumb is to not spend more than 30% of your income on housing costs.
   
      Plus, buying a home is a lot easier said than done in many markets, as the inventory of homes to buy is historically low.
   
      Austin, Texas, offered the biggest discount for renting compared to buying, with renting 121% or $2,013 cheaper per month. It was followed by San Francisco, where renting was 97% less and Seattle was 86% cheaper.
   
      These rent-favoring metros are cities with a higher concentration of tech workers and high earners, where both the average rent-cost and buy-cost are higher than the national average, the report showed.
   
      The advantage of renting is growing in Sun Belt cities, where rents continued to cool faster than other parts of the United States in December, according to Realtor.com.
   
      Just because rents have surged in some cities, doesn’t mean that housing costs haven’t gone up even more. Even in Florida cities like Miami, Tampa and Orlando, which have seen some of the highest rent growth and rent costs in the past year, renting is still more affordable than buying a starter home.
   
      Although renting will likely be cheaper than buying for most people in 2023, rental affordability remains a key issue as prices are expected to hit new highs, said Danielle Hale, Realtor.com’s chief economist.  
   
      “We expect rents will keep hitting new highs, driven by factors including still-low vacancy rates, lagging new construction and demand from would-be first-time buyers,” Hale said.

“Succession,” the king of prestige TV, is returning this March – its acid-tongued dialogue, family infighting and meme-worthy moments intact. 
   
      HBO’s latest trailer for “Succession’s” fourth season pits three of the Roy siblings (minus, Connor, of course) against their father, the unbeatable titan Logan Roy. When we last left them, Shiv’s husband, the typically feeble Tom Wambsgans, fed Logan information that may effectively block the siblings from ever succeeding their father as head honcho of the family company. (HBO and CNN share parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.)
   
      The Roy children vying for Logan’s job (and his love) has always driven the action on the show, but it’s the interpersonal drama that keeps us glued. The trailer sees Tom ask Logan if they’d continue to be partners if he and Shiv were to “bust up.” The Roy patriarch responds ominously:  “If we’re good, we’re good.” Nothing like screwing over one of your children to team up with her spineless partner. (And shortly after she confessed she didn’t “love” him, at that – no “Succession” character has both a healthy personal life and business success!) 
   
      Also seen in the brief trailer: Alexander Skarsgård as tech CEO Lukas Matsson, Shiv marching methodically through a newsroom, Connor and Willa seemingly tying the knot (another “Succession” wedding!) and number-one son Kendall walking ominously toward the ocean (he’s got a weird thing with water). 
   
      It’s just titillating enough to keep us excited until March without revealing too much of the plot that will undoubtedly fuel the digital water cooler this spring. Some lingering questions we have from the trailer:
   
      The acclaimed drama returns just in time to fill the vacancy left by HBO’s apocalyptic game adaptation, “The Last of Us,” whose first season will conclude in March. “Succession” Season 4 premieres March 26.

      Some of the most contentious debates in American education – among them what kinds of stories are (and are not) allowed in the classroom, how teachers should teach US history and navigate LGBTQ issues (when there are states that seek to bar them from discussion) – have led to the resurgence of talk about “parents’ rights.”  
   
      The term is, for a number of Americans, exactly what it sounds like. But therein lies its deceptive risk, because it’s also historically been a conservative talking point, and now it’s back with a vengeance. For the right-wing media ecosystem, “parents’ rights” is now too often a shorthand for a parent’s right to control: the power to decide what their child learns, what their child believes  and what that child does with their body – all while preventing the child’s exposure to anything with which the parent might disagree. 
   
      And while “parents’ rights” or “parental rights” may seem like common sense – of course parents should have the broad ability to guide their children, keep them safe and make decisions that children are too young to take on – those terms are too often trotted out to strip children and teenagers of their basic rights, including to medical care, education, physical safety, freedom (including freedom from sexual violence) and a modicum of privacy. 
   
      Nowhere is this dynamic more visible than in the discourse around trans kids – ubiquitous as a fear tactic in right-leaning media and of late, a point of debate about articles like a recent one in the New York Times asking whether schools should alert parents when their kids change or experiment with their gender identity in school.
   
      It’s understandable that most parents would want to know if their child was undergoing such a significant transition. The question, though, isn’t what it’s reasonable for parents to want, but what it’s reasonable to enforce through laws and regulations. And it is wholly unreasonable to demand that a teenager’s experimentation with identity and belief, so long as that experimentation is not physically dangerous, be disclosed to parents. 
   
      We shouldn’t make laws – or education policy – with only functional, supportive families in mind. It’s tempting to do that, but life experience tells us that not all kids have the families they deserve and research tells us that trans kids without parental support face a host of mental health risks and other challenges. That combination should give anyone pause before deciding what’s reasonable.   
   
      Consider this. Teenagers aren’t yet grownups, but they are in the crucial stages of establishing some independence from their parents, asserting their own identities, forming their own opinions and trying new things. In the hours they are at school, they should find a safe place to do just that, whether that’s the teenager of vegan parents choosing to sample a chicken nugget in the cafeteria or the child of atheists trying out the Christian after-school club or, yes, a teenager who thinks they may be trans trying on a new name and putting on a different wardrobe. 
   
      Context is important here: According to a 2022 report analyzing data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there has been a marked uptick in the number of minors identifying as transgender. While 0.5% of American adults identify as transgender, 1.4% of young people between the ages of 13 and 17 do. Those numbers are even higher in more liberal regions, this report says – in New York state, for example, 3% of young people now identify as trans, which amounts to some 34,000 teenagers. 
   
      Such social changes of course provoke unease, especially when they pertain to something as fundamental as identity. For many, the very act of an individual crossing or transcending the gender binary challenges long-held assumptions about gender roles and ideas about what’s “natural.”
   
      There was a similar parental panic in the 1990s when high school students began coming out as gay or bisexual. A New York Times article from 1997 now seems quite quaint in its observation that “as gay-straight student clubs have sprung up in the last few years, some parents wonder if their children are now getting what these parents, at least, fear is gay propaganda along with a classical education.” 
   
      Some conservative parents may still agree that the very existence of gay-straight alliances propagandize students toward homosexuality, but I imagine most liberal parents understand that they don’t – and that it could pose real problems for teachers or counselors to out students who identify as gay or bisexual to their parents, and that teenagers should be supported in coming out to who they choose, when they choose. 
   
      The same holds true for trans and non-binary teenagers who are experimenting with social transition during the school day. 
   
      There are a great many people and parents who wonder if some of the teenagers identifying as trans or gender-nonconforming are simply in one stage of their adolescent hunt for identity, are seeking attention and the feeling of being different and therefore special, or are facing other mental health issues or developmental disorders.
   
A tiny fraction of minors seek gender-affirming care, which can range from assistance in social transitioning – that is, presenting as one’s identified gender in public – to medical interventions, which themselves range from drugs that help delay the onset of puberty to hormone therapy. Last year, the New York Times reported that in 11 of the leading pediatric gender clinics in the US, 203 top surgeries, or mastectomies, were performed on minors in 2021. That’s out of more than 25 million minors in the US aged 12-17. 
   
      Even well-meaning and generally supportive parents may have questions, including about the long-term health risks versus benefits of drugs that delay puberty and the hormones that may follow. In the meantime, many conservatives have exploited understandable parental fears about their kids making significant emotional and physical changes, casting transgender people and those who support them as “groomers” and dangerous sources of indoctrination. They have drawn gender-affirming care and even the simple recognition of transgender people under the umbrella of “parental rights,” and essentially tell parents, “No one should be making decisions about your child’s gender identity but you.” 
   
      There’s no one easy answer to the question: How much power should parents have over their children’s identities and pursuit of information? 
   
      Many on the right are trying to say it’s simple; to them, the answer is “total.” But even some liberal parents are coming undone at the prospect of not knowing that their teenager’s identity is in flux. In that recent New York Times article, a group of largely self-identified liberal parents share that they were upset that their teenagers began to socially transition at school – using a new name, perhaps, or wearing androgynous clothing or clothes associated with a particular sex. These parents felt that they should know if their kid is identifying as a different gender at school. 
   
      It’s hard not to sympathize with their desires, but those feelings don’t exist in a vacuum. They are happening in a country where minors have very few rights. American kids are wildly unprotected. The kind of physical assaults that would be criminal if they were committed by one adult against another adult are in many states legal when the victim is a child. Child marriage remains legal in most states, including, in some cases, allowing children who are too young to legally consent to sex to nevertheless be married off if that’s what a parent deems appropriate – and it’s Republicans who have largely opposed efforts to raise the legal marriage age. 
   
      Meanwhile, parenting norms, like just about everything else, differ widely along political lines. Research indicates that conservative parents are more likely to use authoritarian parenting methods, demanding obedience and respect for elders over the independence, curiosity and self-reliance more often prioritized by liberal parents. It makes sense why parents with this mentality – destructive as I would argue it is, especially when enforced (as it often is) through physical punishment, threats and shaming – believe that their rights over their children’s lives are near-total. In that worldview, their children have virtually no rights at all. 
   
      This is why norms and informal rules are important: when American children are made this vulnerable by their lack of legal protection, the very least they need are communities (including schools) that see them as individual and worthy human beings, not simple extensions of their parents. 
   
      The more liberal-minded among us, in other words, should push back on this authoritarianism and the demand for parental rights to supersede all else. We must assert the rights of all children to live free of violence and to explore their identities in safe ways without being ratted out to their parents. As grownups, we can project the necessary openness and willingness to listen that researchers say makes us potential allies and sources of support for teens – whether we are their parents or not. 
   
      Yes, this can be uncomfortable. But part of being an adult is advocating for rules and laws that are the best for everyone, and not just the rules and laws that reflect what you individually would like for yourself. And that means advocating for a world in which, yes, parents have rights – but so do children and teens.

      Diplomatic efforts to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon should restart, said International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi, who warned that Tehran has amassed enough material for “several nuclear weapons.” 
   
      Speaking ahead of a planned visit to Tehran, Grossi told a European Parliament subcommittee in Brussels on Wednesday that Iran has not yet built a nuclear weapon and the West should redouble efforts to stop it from doing so.
   
      Uranium enriched to more than 90% can be weaponized. Iran has 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% purity and 1,000 kilograms to 20% purity, according to Grossi.
   
      The IAEA chief is heading to Tehran in February for a “much needed political dialogue” despite the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear deal signed with Iran in 2015, being “in a very bad shape,” he said.
   
      Grossi described the JCPOA as “an empty shell,” saying diplomatic activity linked to reviving the 2015 nuclear deal is close to non-existent.
   
      “Nobody has declared it dead, but no obligation is being pursued, and … every limit that existed in the JCPOA has been violated several times,” Grossi said.
   
      Last year, the IAEA asked Iran to explain why traces of uranium were detected in three areas that were not supposed to be dedicated to nuclear activity. Iran retaliated by removing 27 of the IAEA’s cameras.
   
      On Tuesday, Grossi said that the move left his agency “blind” on several aspects, including how much material, equipment and centrifuges currently exist.
   
      Grossi’s planned visit was confirmed by Mohammad Eslami, the head of Iran’s atomic agency, who said Tehran is expecting a visit from the IAEA chief, Fars news agency reported on Wednesday.  
   
      The decline in attempts to revive the deal has come at a time of increased tensions between the US and Iran.
   
      The European Union has mediated indirect talks between Washington and Tehran aimed at relaunching the nuclear deal, but negotiations stalled after the Iranian government demanded further guarantees.
   
      The talks were then brought to a complete halt by nationwide protests in Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini in September.
   
      “The JCPOA has not been on the agenda for months,” US State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Tuesday.
   
      The Biden administration also introduced sanctions on Tehran following a government crackdown on protesters, which has included executions of those accused of being involved.

      Ukraine has urged the West to get military hardware into the hands of its troops as quickly as possible, as Russia fired missiles toward Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities just hours after Germany and the US announced their plans to provide modern tanks to the country.
   
      Russia launched 55 missiles at Ukraine on Thursday morning, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Telegram. Shmyhal said the salvo was aimed at the country’s “energy facilities” and some power substations had been hit.
   
      “The main targets were energy facilities to deprive Ukrainians of power and warmth,” Shmyhal said on Telegram. “The majority of missiles and drones were intercepted by our defenders. Unfortunately there were hits at substations. Nevertheless the situation in the power grid remains under control. Power engineers are doing everything to provide power supply.”
   
      Emergency power outages were introduced in the Kyiv region after the attack.
   
      One person died in the capital, and an air raid alert was in place across the whole country, according to the city’s mayor. The person who died was identified as a 55-year-old man, who was killed “due to the fall of missile fragments,” he head of the Kyiv city military administration, Serhiy Popko, added.
   
      Popko accused Russia of using the Iranian-made attack drones it sent to Ukraine overnight to try and distract Ukrainian air defense units. Fifteen attack drones were fired over over the capital on Thursday, “aimed not only at hitting targets on the ground,” he said. “According to the new tactics of the aggressor, the drones constitute the first wave of a combined air attack for detecting and exhausting Ukrainian air defense.”
   
      The fresh assault comes amid Russian rage at the West’s decision to provide Ukraine with high-tech tanks. Germany finally approved the transport of Leopard 2 tanks on Wednesday, joining the US in sending a batch of vehicles after weeks of geopolitical negotiations.
   
      But a race to get those tanks onto the battlefield has now begun, and Thursday’s attack indicates Moscow will aim to damage Ukrainian resolve in the intervening period.
   
      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the West for further weapons supplies following the attack.”This evil, this Russian aggression can and should be stopped only with adequate weapons,” Zelensky told Ukrainians in his nightly address on Thursday. “Weapons on the battlefield. Weapons that protect our skies.”
   
      Ukraine was able to shoot down most of the missiles, a feat Zelensky attributed to the Western-donated air defense systems.
   
      “Today, thanks to the air defense systems provided to Ukraine and the professionalism of our warriors, we managed to shoot down most of the Russian missiles and Shaheds,” he said. “These are at least hundreds of lives saved and dozens of infrastructure facilities preserved.”
   
      Germany is planning to deliver its 14 pledged Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by the end of March “at the latest,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced Thursday. That will follow a period of training for Ukrainian soldiers.
   
      ”This is not too late,” Pistorius said. 
   
      The arrival of 31 American Abrams tanks is expected to take far longer, given the complexity of the systems and the logistics of getting a battalion across the Atlantic Ocean and into eastern Ukraine. In the meantime, the US will begin a “comprehensive training program” for the Ukrainians, which will require significant maintenance once they are deployed, according to the White House.
   
      Kyiv will hope that Germany’s Leopards are incorporated into their operations before an anticipated Russian offensive in the spring begins. 
   
      Alongside Russia’s Thursday attack on Ukraine came another round of anger from the Kremlin over the supply of tanks. President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Moscow sees the delivery of modern Western battle tanks to Ukraine as “direct involvement” in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
   
      But NATO nations dismissed Russia’s ire, and shown a willingness to open up a possible new stage of the war with weapons that will allow Ukraine to take the fighting to Moscow’s forces, rather than focus on repelling Russian attacks.
   
      Kyiv is also continuing to press for more Western stocks, including improved missile systems and modern fighter jets. “We have to unlock the supply of long-range missiles to Ukraine, it is important for us to expand our cooperation in artillery, we have to achieve the supply of aircraft to Ukraine,” Zelensky said on Wednesday, adding he had spoken with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg about the desire.
   
      Zelensky referred to the request as “a dream,” but also “an important task for all of us,” indicating another lengthy period of international dialogue in which Ukraine will look to warm up the West to the entire of stepping up its military aid again.
   
      The country’s defense minister meanwhile told CNN on Wednesday that Ukraine’s “wish list” for Western-supplied weapons includes fighter jets.
   
      “I sent a wish list card to Santa Claus last year, and fighter jets also [were] including in this wish list,” Oleksii Reznikov told Christiane Amanpour.
   
      But he said that his government’s first priority was air defense systems, to prevent Russia from carrying out air and missile strikes. “We have to close our sky, to defend our sky,” he said. “That’s priority number one. After that, we need to get more armed vehicles, tanks, artillery systems, UAVs, etc. etc. We have people, but we need weaponry.”
   
      On the ground, Russian forces were “intensifying their pressure” on the eastern city of Bakhmut, Ukraine’s deputy defense minister said on Wednesday.
   
      “The intensity of the battles is increasing,” Hanna Maliar said on Telegram. “The enemy is intensifying their pressure at the Bakhmut and Vuhledar directions. Heavy fighting continues.” That account tallies with two Ukrainian soldiers in Bakhmut, who said Wednesday that Russian forces were attempting to advance north and south of the city, with one telling CNN that the situation was “very alarming.”

      The United States has transferred American munitions stored in Israel for use in Ukraine and plans to send more soon, US and Israeli officials told CNN Wednesday.
   
      A US official told CNN they have moved “some” of the 300,000 155-millimeter shells that the US and Israel agreed would be transferred, and that there are plans to move the remaining amount in the coming weeks.
   
      Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Richard Hecht told CNN that the Americans notified the Israelis a while ago they were transferring munitions. Hecht said the munitions are US-owned, that their movements are “American business” and that they don’t need Israeli permission to move the munitions.
   
      “In support of security assistance packages to Ukraine via the Presidential Drawdown Authority, the DOD has been able to transfer materiel and equipment while maintaining military readiness. Due to operational security considerations, we will not discuss the location or units providing the equipment or materiel,” Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said in a statement. “As we provide aid to Ukraine, we are also working to replenish US inventories and backfill depleted stocks of allies and partners.”
   
The New York Times first reported the American military is tapping into its munitions stockpile stored in Israel for use in Ukraine, noting Israeli officials had initially expressed “concerns about appearing complicit in arming Ukraine.”
   
      Israel has been walking a fine diplomatic line during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While Israeli leaders have condemned the invasion, supported Ukraine in the United Nations, sent humanitarian aid and taken in refugees, Israel has drawn a hard line at sending military aid, citing its own security sensitivities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before he took office at the end of December that he would review Israel’s policy on Russia’s war in Ukraine.   
   
      The strain on weapons stockpiles – and the ability of the US industrial base to keep up with demand – is one of the key challenges facing the Biden administration as the US continues to send billions of dollars of weapons to Ukraine to support its fight against Russia. CNN previously reported a US official said the stockpiles of certain systems are “dwindling” after months of sending supplies to Kyiv during the high-intensity war, as there’s “finite amount” of excess stocks which the US has available to send.
   
      CNN reported in November that the US intended to buy 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition from South Korean arms manufacturers to provide to Ukraine as part of a broader effort to find available weaponry for the high-intensity battles unfolding in Ukraine.

      A modest drop in mortgage rates over the past month has helped home builder confidence improve in January, after 12 consecutive months of falling, according to a survey released Wednesday.
   
      Experts say that could mean new home building is set for a pivot as construction prospects improve. And that’s good news for home buyers who have been facing a low inventory amid a national shortfall in building for decades.
   
      The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index is meant to gauge market conditions and looks at current sales, buyer traffic and the outlook for sales of new construction homes over the next six months. 
   
      All three metrics rose in January, marking the first improvement in builder sentiment since December 2021.
   
      Although builders continue to grapple with elevated construction costs, building material supply chain disruptions and challenging affordability conditions, the rise in the index suggests the worst may have passed, said Jerry Konter, NAHB Chairman.
   
      The survey found home builders’ confidence rose this month from its December level, which was the lowest sentiment level since 2012 — aside from the immediate onset of the pandemic. 
   
      “It appears the low point for builder sentiment in this cycle was registered in December, even as many builders continue to use a variety of incentives, including price reductions, to bolster sales,” Konter said. “The rise in builder sentiment also means that cycle lows for permits and starts are likely near, and a rebound for home building could be underway later in 2023.”
   
      Even as mortgage rates surged for much of 2022, crushing the demand for homes, inventory of homes to buy has not swelled. Few existing homes are available as homeowners dig in to their current homes holding on to the ultra-low interest rates they secured over the past few years.
   
      Building in 2023 is still expected to be lower than last year, said Robert Dietz, NAHB chief economist, but January could be a turning point.
   
      “In the coming quarters, single-family home building will rise off of cycle lows as mortgage rates are expected to trend lower and boost housing affordability,” he said. “Improved housing affordability will increase housing demand, as the nation grapples with a structural housing deficit of 1.5 million units.”
   
      Mortgage rates for a 30-year fixed-rate loan are now 6.33%, according to Freddie Mac. That is nearly double the rate a year ago, but down from the 2022 high of 7.08% reached in October and November.

      Grab a box of tissues because Plain White T’s singer Tom Higgenson is about to melt your heart. 
   
      The band posted a heartwarming video to their Instagram on January 17 showcasing Higgenson surprising a young cancer patient with a performance of “Hey There Delilah” in her hospital room. 
   
      The patient is named Delilah and has been fighting cancer for over 4 years, according to a caption on the video. 
   
      The band said that Delilah’s favorite song has been “Hey There Delilah” throughout her cancer treatments, so they surprised her with a live rendition. 
   
      “I hear you’re a big fan of our song ‘Hey There Delilah’ so I figured I would play it for you right now,” Higgenson said in the video, filmed by Isaiah Garza. 
   
      Higgenson then stepped right into Delilah’s hospital room, much to her delight, as he played the hit song at her bedside. Gasps could be heard from others in the room, and Delilah smiled as Higgenson crooned. 
   
      The room then erupted in a group sing-along of the Grammy-nominated song before Delilah and Higgenson shared a hug. 
   
      “Delilah” topped the Billboard Hot 100 charts when it was released in 2006 and is still considered to be one of the songs that defined pop music in the 2010’s. 
   
      In 2018, it was reported that the band was adapting the song into a TV show. “A whole lot of people really connected with that song,” Higgenson told The Hollywood Reporter. “And I’m very proud of that.”

Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said.
   
      Plans by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to look at ways for those athletes to return to international competition would be opposed, the minister, Vadim Guttsait, said on social media late on Thursday.
   
      “Our position is unchanged: as long as there is a war in Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes should not be in international competitions,” Guttsait wrote on his Facebook page.
   
      “Work is currently underway on further possible steps and first steps to continue sanctions and prevent Russians and Belarusians from international competitions,” he said.
   
      “If we are not heard, I do not rule out the possibility that we will boycott and refuse participation in the Olympics.”
   
      He later wrote that talks with national sports federations would begin on a possible boycott of the Paris Olympics “in case of allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to international sports arenas.”
   
      Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, many sports organizations have moved events and suspended Russian teams or athletes, while sponsors have ended contracts in protests against the war.
   
      Russian and Belarusian athletes have been banned in some sports while they are allowed to compete under a neutral flag in others.
   
      The IOC, eager to see them back in international competitions, said on Wednesday the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) had offered Russian and Belarusian athletes the chance to compete in Asia, giving them a qualification pathway for the Paris Olympics.
   
      In a call with IOC President Thomas Bach in December, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy opposed the idea of Russian athletes taking part under any kind of neutral banner in the 2024 Summer Games.

      Chevron reported a record full-year profit of $36.5 billion, buoyed by high oil prices. 
   
      Adjusted earnings for the year more than doubled from the $15.6 billion Chevron earned in 2021 and up 36% from its previous record profit set in 2011.
   
      The oil company’s fourth-quarter earnings came in at $7.9 billion, up 61% from a year earlier but less than the record quarterly income of $11.4 billion it reported for the second quarter.  
   
      The fourth quarter earnings per share of $4.09 fell short of the forecast of $4.38 a share from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. But revenue in the quarter of $56.5 billion topped forecasts by nearly $2 billion and was up 17% from a year earlier. 
   
      Full-year revenue of $246.3 billion was up 52% from 2021.
   
      Shares of Chevron
            
                (CVX) were down slightly more than 1% in premarket trading.
   
      Ahead of Friday’s report Chevron, the nation’s second largest oil company, behind only ExxonMobil, had announced it was hiking its dividend by 6% along with a massive $75 billion share repurchase plan. The decision brought criticism from those who said oil companies should be investing their money in producing more oil and gasoline to increase supply and drive down prices for inflation-weary drivers.
   
      “For a company that claimed not too long ago that it was ‘working hard’ to increase oil production, handing out $75 billion to executives and wealthy shareholders sure is an odd way to show it,” said Abdullah Hasan, assistant press secretary at the White House, in a tweet Wednesday evening after the share repurchase was announced. 
   
      Chevron said Friday its investments in operations increased by more than 75% from 2021, and annual US production increased to the equivalent of 1.2 million barrels of oil a day. 
   
      The amount it spent on capital spending and exploration in 2022 was $12.3 billion, up 43% compared with $8.6 billion spent in 2021, but only slightly more than the $11 billion it spent on dividends or the $11.3 billion on share repurchases during the year. 
   
      The record profit came primarily from the soaring oil prices during the year, not its increased production. 
   
      Chevron and other major oil companies all benefited from the spike in oil and gasoline prices during 2022, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While Russia, one of the world’s leading oil exporters, sent relatively little oil to the United States, sanctions placed on Russia following the invasion roiled global commodity prices which set the price of oil.
   
      Futures for a barrel of Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, hit a record of $123.58 close in early June, up more than 50% from six months earlier ahead of the war, and the average price of a gallon of regular gas in the United States broke the $5 mark a week later to reach a record $5.03.
   
      But oil and gas prices have fallen substantially since then. Brent closed Thursday at $87.47, slightly below the year-earlier level, while the average price of a gallon of regular gas stands at $3.51 a gallon, only slightly higher from the $3.35 average of a year ago.
   
      But prices have started to rise once again, partly because Covid lockdown rules in China have been lifted. Traders believe that’s a bullish sign for global demand for oil and gasoline. Refinery problems caused by winter weather are also pushing prices higher. 
   
      The average US price of a gallon of regular gasoline is up nearly 12 cents in just the last week and up 41 cents, or 13%, in the last month. Brent oil is up 12% in the last three weeks.

      Just days into Kevin McCarthy’s tenure, Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska had an issue he needed the House speaker to address. 
   
      Bacon told CNN he had the impression that two bills were being fast tracked for floor votes. Neither was on the calendar officially, but Bacon was worried. One of them was a hardline border bill authored by Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas that concerned some moderates because of the way it handled asylum claims. The other, the Fair Tax Act, moved to abolish the IRS and impose a hefty sales tax instead. 
   
      Neither bill, Bacon argued to McCarthy’s staff in a phone call last week, had the votes to pass with members of the centrist-leaning Main Street Caucus. Both, he said, could be improved with amendments and by going through the committee process. 
   
      “I called and said that’s BS,” Bacon told CNN of the idea these bills would go straight to the floor. “It’s gotta go through committee just like every other bill, and I think these bills will be improved.”
   
      He was assured: The bills would go through regular order. 
   
      It’s the kind of member management and careful tap dance that foreshadows the delicate balance ahead for GOP leadership. Their majority is narrow and divided sharply between the moderates – who hail from Biden-won districts and are the reason Republicans have the majority in the first place – and the hardliners who from the outset have asserted themselves as the ultimate deciders of McCarthy’s fate as speaker. 
   
      That dynamic, combined with a lengthy list of concessions McCarthy made in his quest to secure the speaker’s gavel, could make it more difficult for the House GOP to pass even messaging bills – let alone essential and heavier lifts like raising the nation’s borrowing limit or politically dicey questions like whether to impeach President Joe Biden or a member of his Cabinet. 
   
      Further complicating matters, McCarthy abolished the House’s remote voting system put in place during the pandemic, making the GOP’s razor-thin majority even more tenuous. Already, House Republicans are down one vote for the next few weeks with the absence of Rep. Greg Steube of Florida, who was recently injured after a fall.
 
      “Our biggest challenge will be attendance,” House Majority Whip Tom Emmer told CNN in an interview. “People staying healthy and staying on the field.”  
   
      It’s an issue Emmer is already trying to encourage members to communicate with him about early.
   
      In a closed-door meeting Wednesday, Emmer asked members for a few things he argued would help Republicans succeed in the months ahead. First, he told them, he needed to know if members had even the smallest unease with legislation before it came to the floor. Second, he asked them to trust him with their personal business. Members have families, health issues, absences and their own calendars to manage, he acknowledged during the meeting. But with a narrow margin, even a few absences can cause a calamity on the floor.  
   
      Emmer said he told his conference Wednesday, “We are not in the business of discussing your business. You gotta view us as a small-town law office. Information comes in, but it doesn’t go out.” 
   
      It’s a familiar saga for any new leadership, Democratic or Republican, in which the campaign rhetoric is always harder to implement than it is to promise. Republicans were united on the trail in their messages against crime, an overrun border, out-of-control spending and an inept IRS. But the very real details of how to fix the issues now with a narrow and diverse majority that can’t vote remotely anymore are already proving to be a test for leaders and the entire Republican conference – especially after McCarthy committed to a more transparent legislative process.
   
      “We all say we want regular order and the old traditional process. Well, this is what it entails,” Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, a member of the GOP leadership team, told CNN. “It may slow things down, but it’s healthy for the institution.”
   
      Emmer now finds himself smack dab in the middle of the fray. A lawmaker who cut his teeth as the director of the party’s campaign arm in the last two election cycles, Emmer credits part of his ascension to leadership with the lessons he learned as a hockey coach and in the state legislature in Minnesota, often regaling his staff and members with stories from his days navigating team dynamics in a sport that is everything back home.  
   
      Emmer’s biggest job now: counting. It’s a practice he’s already become familiar with in the opening days of the 118th Congress. It was Emmer and his “cheerful persistence,” Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina recalled, who helped forge the negotiations between the 20 hardliners and the Speaker’s office that eventually won McCarthy the gavel after 15 ballots.
   
      “He understands the political moment we are in, and he understands members and he actually is secretly a policy guy too. It’s a tough job, but he has the capacity to pull people together,” McHenry said. “He’s quite flexible in how he responds, but he is dogged in pursuing the outcome.”
   
      During the heated speaker’s race, Emmer was seen as a trusted negotiator even for conservatives who were more hesitant to engage directly with McCarthy after a tense conference meeting early in the race. 
   
      “Tom’s pretty open. You kind of know where you stand right up front whether you like it or not, which is good,” Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, one of those 20 hardliners, told CNN. “He’s direct.”
   
      That directness, Emmer told CNN in an interview comes from years in the state legislature where he used to shudder at messages from his more seasoned colleagues that he needed to keep his “powder dry.”
   
      “In my mind, I think you get a better result when you have some tension, when you have some conflict, when you get people … you poke them until they get upset and they want to tell you something,” Emmer said. “Too many people in this business do not want to offend. They don’t want to have that discussion and because they don’t want to offend another human being, they don’t tell you what they are actually thinking and what is bothering them.”
   
      Emmer’s philosophy is his office has to be a safe space, a place where members can come freely, early and often with their concerns, some of which he is already familiar with after shepherding them through their elections as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
   
      “He knows a lot of these new members because he helped recruit them and helped them win their elections,” said Rep. Jeff Duncan, a Republican from South Carolina. “That gives him a leg up.”  
   
      But Emmer’s most challenging days are ahead with the House on a collision course with the White House on the debt ceiling and the country’s financial outlook at stake. McCarthy promised he wouldn’t put a clean debt ceiling bill on the floor and that any increase in the country’s borrowing limit would have to come with spending cuts. What and how deep those cuts are could be yet another place where GOP disagreements take hold. 
   
      While House Republicans – including those in Biden-won districts – are largely in agreement with McCarthy’s position that they should demand spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, there’s less consensus about where those cuts should come from or whether they should touch entitlement programs.
   
      And then there are some Republicans, such as hardline conservative Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who don’t think they should raise the nation’s borrowing limit under any circumstances, further complicating the path forward for GOP leaders.
   
      “Everybody’s conservative, until it cuts their program,” said South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, a conservative hardliner. “So we’ll see how it works out.”
   
      In the opening days of the new Congress, the conference has already found itself at odds over legislation that was supposed to be the easy stuff. 
   
      Bills that seemed to unite the conference in the minority were punted. One of them, legislation that would require prosecutors to report the data of crimes they chose to prosecute and not to prosecute, stalled out after conservatives raised concerns about the federal government imposing too much power in local jurisdictions. A vote on a resolution on policing also was delayed as was a vote on legislation that would have required gun shop owners to call immigration services if an immigrant residing in the US illegally tried to buy a gun. 
   
      Even the House rules package, which governs how the House operates and is the first piece of legislation the chamber votes on each Congress, had become a point of contention inside the Republican conference, with some members worried about the deals McCarthy cut to become speaker.
   
      Leadership and rank-and-file members chalk up some of the early scuttles as growing pains, but not a sign of things to come. They also argue that working out the kinks before bills come to the floor will only strengthen the legislative process, even if it slows things down.
   
      “Bills are always better when they’ve gone through committee first,” McCarthy told CNN. “Look, we’ve got a five-seat majority. When we had a 27-seat majority, we had challenges. But you can’t just throw something on the floor. That’s why the committee will be a better process.”
   
      Others pointed out that the House GOP is only now getting up and running after being delayed by a once-in-a-century floor fight over electing McCarthy as speaker.
   
      “We didn’t have rules, we didn’t have committees. The single best way to avoid it is to bring stuff through regular order,” Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican from North Dakota, told CNN. “I think there is a transition from the minority to the majority. When you have a three- or four-vote majority depending on attendance, you can’t just bring stuff to the floor without vetting it.”
   
      Rep. Tony Gonzales, who represents a swing district, ended up voting against the package, despite a behind-the-scenes effort by leadership to quell members’ concerns. And the Texas Republican made clear his willingness to stand up to his own party is not limited to the rules package.
   
      “I’m a retired master chief and nobody knows what a retired master chief is,” Gonzales told CNN, referring to his career in the Navy, “but if you do a little research on what a retired master chief is, it will be crystal clear why I’m going to be a pain in the ass.” 
   
      Gonzales has also been an outspoken critic of the border security plan backed by Roy, which was one of the bills McCarthy promised to put on the floor in his bid to become speaker. 
   
      As part of those negotiations, McCarthy also agreed to let the controversial Fair Tax Act move through “regular order” – in other words, letting the House Ways and Means Committee vote on it and see if it has enough support to get to the floor. But it has already lost support of at least one key lawmaker: McCarthy himself.
   
      “No,” McCarthy told CNN when asked if he backs the bill.
   
      In the coming days, Republicans will face another test when they put a resolution on the House floor to remove Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota from the House Foreign Affairs Committee over rhetoric perceived as antisemitic.
   
      At least two Republicans have signaled they will oppose the resolution, and several more are undecided, but GOP leaders are optimistic they’ll ultimately have the votes.
   
      “You’ll see,” Emmer told reporters. “We’ve got what we need.”
   
      It won’t be the last close vote.
   
      “Given the narrow majority, this is not going to be easy for us week after week,” Republican Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas said, adding a favorite saying he recalled former Republican House Speaker John Boehner used to invoke: “How do you keep all those jumping frogs in the wheelbarrow when you are trying to move down the road?”

      Dug in amid the rolling hills west of Bakhmut, the tanks of the Ukrainian army’s 28th Mechanized Brigade are helping to hold the line against a growing Russian offensive. 
   
      They are battered and bruised by nearly a year of combat, but despite their age they are cherished by their crews. 
   
      The young tank commander, who goes by the call sign David, sees his unit’s role as crucial in holding the line, and preventing a Russian advance towards the straggling industrial town of Konstantinyvka. 
   
      “We just work against them. If we don’t, they will come closer and we will lose our houses and families. We stand here to let people peacefully live in their houses. If the Russians come to Konstantinyvka – what will happen? They will destroy it, not leaving a stone standing.” 
   
      The 28th has had a long war already. It was in the south helping to liberate Kherson before being sent half-way across the country. But it prides itself on one of the lowest casualty rates among Ukrainian brigades. 
   
      As David talks, the air is split by the sound of outgoing fire from tanks and artillery. A howitzer is in action on the other side of the hill. Their targets are positions held by the Russian mercenary group Wagner south of Bakhmut, several miles away. 
   
      But the 28th uses its 125-millimeter shells sparingly. “We have problems with ammunition, we are running low on it,” David says. “But that’s the only problem we have. We get enough spare parts, our commanders work all the time to sustain and repair the tanks.” 
   
      Sometimes, all it needs is the appearance of a tank in forward positions to scatter Wagner fighters, who are mostly lightly-armed infantry.  
   
      “When we come and fire, the enemy goes silent for two to three days,” David says. “They won’t fire at our guys in the trenches. If our tanks and artillery don’t fire, our infantry will suffer.” 
   
      Recent video geolocated by CNN south of Bakhmut showed two Ukrainian tanks advancing towards Wagner positions, as the Russian positions were also attacked by Ukrainian drones from above.  
   
      But the waves keep coming. Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesman for the armed forces in the east, said Friday: “The Russians are trying to break through our defenses, ignoring enormous losses of their own. It used to be a barrage of fire, now it is barrage of personnel.
   
      “Their key weapon now is manpower. In Bakhmut, those are the Wagner PMC but not exclusively…in Vuhledar, the key assault forces are marines and infantry units, along with conscripts.” 
   
      Vuhledar – another town in Donetsk – has also come under intense attack in the last few days. 
   
      Like all Ukrainian units, the 28th is sensitive to any filming that might give away its locations. Minutes after we are asked not to film anything that might be geolocated, a drone flies over the site. 
   
      The men squint into the sky but soon relax: it’s not Russian. In fact, David says, “for a tank crew it is easy working here. It is difficult for enemy artillery to find our tanks or other vehicles. They don’t have enough forces to locate and hit our vehicles.” 
   
      Still, the tanks are moved frequently. “We can move into position, fire and easily come back.” 
   
      That advantage may be lost as the Russians bring up reinforcements, including howitzers and multiple-launch rocket systems. These will be critical days and weeks in defending the roughly 40% of Donetsk region still in Ukrainian hands. 
   
      The question is whether Ukrainian forces can hold their current positions – before being reinforced by the arrival of scores of Western tanks, which could take up to two months. 
   
      Asked whether CNN could film a “trophy tank” that the 28th seized from the Russians, its crew laugh and say: “In return for an Abrams.” 
   
      The Western main battle tanks pledged in the last week cannot arrive soon enough. They’d bring greater firepower and survivability at a time when tank warfare has become an important part of the conflict.   
   
      Hamish de Bretton Gordon, former commanding officer of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment in the British Army, says the Challengers being sent by the UK are vastly superior to anything the Russians have.  
   
      “They can fire accurately on the move and at night across rough terrain. They can carry more rounds (50+) to 30 on a T-72.  And they are much better protected. A Challenger L2 will probably take four or five direct hits from a T-72 and survive – while one hit [from a Challenger] will destroy a T-72.” 
   
      Western tanks would also allow Ukraine to conduct combined arms maneuvers if supported by infantry and artillery. A Challenger can move up to 300 miles in a day without need for replenishment. 
   
      Ukrainian officials have told CNN that they want between 400 and 600 Western tanks to help change the course of the war. 
   
      De Bretton Gordon says that 300 tanks would amount to a division “and would allow Ukraine to conduct devastating and wide-ranging attacks to dislocate the static Russians. Plus, they would be supported by the 1,000 or so (Russian tanks) which Ukraine already has.” 
   
      Much of southern and eastern Ukraine is ideal terrain for combinations of modern Western tanks and armored fighting vehicles to spearhead a counteroffensive. 
   
      Western tanks would also help deal with the sort of threat posed by the waves of Wagner fighters. Leopard 2s, Abrams and British Challengers all carry heavy machine guns, which would devastate infantry in open land. 
   
      The Leopard 2 has another advantage, given the incredible rate at which ammunition is being used in Ukraine. The ammunition for its 120 mm gun is widely available among NATO armies. 
   
      US Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli, NATO’s supreme allied commander, said last week that, “in the end, a tank simply comes down to, conceptually, a balance between firepower, mobility and protection.” In each category, Western tanks outscore their Russian counterparts. 
   
      The Ukrainians’ one advantage in operating the Soviet-era tanks is familiarity. 
   
      “It depends on the crew, not the tank,” David says, as he leans on his T-64. “An experienced crew can deal with any situation. Among all the tanks, T-72, T-80, T-90, this is my favorite. Everyone can take another crew member’s place. The mechanic can be a commander if I am wounded.” 
   
      He adds that the crew can maintain the T-64 themselves. “If the gun breaks down during a combat mission we have enough experience to fix it.” 
   
      Those combat missions are likely to come thick and fast in the weeks to come, before Western tanks begin to arrive in numbers in the spring.

      New York to San Francisco. Baltimore to Portland. Boston to Los Angeles, and countless cities in between. 
   
Protesters once again took to the streets over the weekend to decry police brutality after the release of video capturing the violent Memphis police beating that led to the death of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols.
   
      On Sunday morning, Nichols’ family attorney made note of the outrage as he aimed a simple but pointed message at Washington. 
   
      “Shame on us if we don’t use [Nichols’] tragic death to finally get the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed,” Ben Crump said on CNN’s “State of Union.”
 
President Joe Biden referenced the failed legislation in his statement about Nichols on Friday, and many leaders – from the chairs of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio – are acknowledging a potential role for federal legislation.
   
      The Congressional Black Caucus is requesting a meeting with Biden this week to push for negotiations. “We are calling on our colleagues in the House and Senate to jumpstart negotiations now and work with us to address the public health epidemic of police violence that disproportionately affects many of our communities,” CBC Chair Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, wrote in a statement on Sunday. 
   
      Gloria Sweet-Love, the Tennessee State Conference NAACP president, called on Congress to step up during a Sunday evening news conference in Memphis. “By failing to craft and pass bills to stop police brutality, you’re writing another Black man’s obituary. The blood of Black America is on your hands. So stand up and do something.”
   
      But with Congress as divided as ever, it appears public outrage is once again on a collision course with Washington partisanship. 
   
      Here’s what you need to know about the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, why it failed, and what chances it stands in the current political climate. 
   
      The legislation, originally introduced in 2020 and again in 2021, would set up a national registry of police misconduct to stop officers from evading consequences for their actions by moving to another jurisdiction.
   
      It would ban racial and religious profiling by law enforcement at the federal, state and local levels, and it would overhaul qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that critics say shields law enforcement from accountability.
   
      According to a fact sheet on the legislation at the time, the measure would also allow “individuals to recover damages in civil court when law enforcement officers violate their constitutional rights by eliminating qualified immunity for law enforcement.”
   
      The fact sheet also states that the legislation would “save lives by banning chokeholds and no-knock warrants” and would mandate “deadly force be used only as a last resort.”
   
      The bill twice cleared the House under Democratic control – in 2020 and 2021 – largely along party lines. But it never went anywhere in the Senate, even after Democrats won control in 2021, in part, because of disagreements about qualified immunity, which protects police officers from being sued in civil court.
   
      Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina spent some six months trying to hash out a deal that could win 60 votes in the Senate, but talks were stymied by a number of complicated issues.
   
      “It was clear at this negotiating table, in this moment, we were not making progress,” Booker told reporters in the spring of 2021. “In fact, recent back-and-forth with paper showed me that we were actually moving away from it. The negotiations we were in stopped. But the work will continue.”
   
      With the legislation stuck, Biden signed a more limited executive order to overhaul policing on the second anniversary of Floyd’s death. It took several actions that can be applied to federal officers, including efforts to ban chokeholds, expand the use of body-worn cameras and restrict no-knock warrants, among other things.
   
      But the president cannot mandate that local law enforcement adopt the measures in his order; the executive action lays out levers the federal government can use, such as federal grants and technical assistance, to incentivize local law enforcement to get on board
   
      And since then, little has happened on the federal legislative front. 
   
      Here’s the reality: the road for police reform has only become more challenging in the new Congress now that House Republicans, who have placed their priorities elsewhere, are in the majority.
   
      Senate Democrats picked up one more seat in last year’s midterm elections to pad their majority, but they’re still far short of the 60 votes that would be need for such an effort to succeed. That means any policing overhaul that can find meaningful support in Congress will likely be stripped of the kind of measures that protesters are calling for. 
   
      State officials have been initiating investigations into local police departments, recognizing that the federal government can’t take on every case nationwide. 
   
      And, in some cases, local governments have taken their own steps. In the year after Floyd was killed, at least 25 states had considered some form of qualified immunity reform. In 2021, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed into law a series of police reforms that created a system to decertify law enforcement officers found to have engaged in serious misconduct – joining the majority of states that have similar decertification authorities.
   
      But, for many, it’s not nearly enough. Read this CNN Opinion piece from Sonia Pruitt, a retired Montgomery County, Maryland, police captain:
   
“Many have noted the police assault on Nichols is reminiscent of that on Rodney King, a Black man whose beating at the hands of Los Angeles police officers in 1991 was captured on video. But the beating of Nichols is actually much worse because it shows that after nearly 32 years, the needle of police reform has barely moved, and seemingly minor traffic violations continue to lead to the deaths of Black and other minority men and women in police encounters.”

      The egalitarian nature of ballroom dance is why many older Asian American immigrants use it to practice their social and physical fitness. As dancers move, everyday problems roll off elegantly gesturing fingers and pointed toes. 
   
      Thu Luu, a competitive ballroom dancer and teacher who owns the Ballroom & Country Dance Studio in Calgary, Alberta, explained to me that, as recreational pastimes go, ballroom dancing is not too expensive, and it’s a great way to work through tough emotions.  
   
      But there is something he can’t seem to shake — the identity of the gunman, who on the eve of Lunar New Year, fatally shot 11 people, and wounded nine others in a Monterey Park, California, dance hall.
   
      Luu didn’t know the gunman, but he recognized a connection: They were both refugees who escaped war-torn Vietnam. In 1980, Luu arrived in Canada and rebuilt his life by working as a welder. He learned a new language and customs. At night, ballroom dancing was an entry point to his adopted homeland because when words failed, he could communicate through movement.
   
      While we talked, Luu, 63, apologized often for his halting English but quickly added, “I am well-educated in dance.”
   
      In many ways, I am connected to Luu and the Monterey Park tragedy, too. I can recognize the struggle. I witnessed my Vietnamese refugee parents battle to establish a toehold in American life without easy access to a supportive community or resources. 
   
      Long after the war in their home country ended, they continued to live in survival mode in the margins of American society, in part, because the luxuries I enjoy by birthright as a second-generation Asian American — freedom, education, language access — are all things for which they had to fight. 
   
      Now in their 70s, my parents have found time and space for recreation. They do exercise and other rigorous movement with friends. They don’t work out on a dance floor, but the intent is the same — it’s an opportunity to move their bodies with a diverse community of older adults, free from judgment. In this place, I see my parents laugh, with eyes twinkling gleefully. 
   
      I recognized the expressions of joy when I used to walk from my old studio apartment in downtown Alhambra, California, by Lai Lai Ballroom & Studio, site of the second Lunar New Year Eve incident by the gunman. The same armed man who opened fire in Monterey Park showed up there — presumably looking once again to inflict violence on older immigrants like himself. Fortunately it was the end of the evening, and the ballroom was almost empty. An attendant, Brandan Tsay, was able to wrest away his firearm, in the process possibly saving many lives had the shooter headed to yet another dance venue. 
   
      During my walks, clusters of older adults would sometimes burst out the doors glistening with sweat and sequins, but mostly I just heard the cadence of ballroom music wafting through the air to remind me that these are sacred places for older Asian Americans in the golden days of their lives to find joy and release from daily pressure. 
   
      Ballroom dance attracts a mature crowd — about 55 years and older, said Bailey Morgan-Whitfield, studio manager and dance instructor at the Fred Astaire Dance Studios in Arcadia, California. Morgan-Whitfield told me that most of the clientele at her studio consists of older Asian Americans, who keep coming, she thinks, because the community is craving social interaction. This is especially true after the isolation of the pandemic and the anxiety stoked by spikes in anti-Asian hate.
   
      In Asian immigrant communities, dance is a great escape, and it has roots in American history. In the 1920s and 30s, taxi dance halls were dance spaces that allowed young Filipino men employed as farmworkers to cut a rug in their limited leisure time. There was little else they could do — laws at the time limited the number of Filipinas in the United States, prohibited interracial marriage and even prevented Asian American land ownership. 
   
      For disenfranchised communities, dance can be subversive and revolutionary. It can represent an act of joyful rebellion that exists today on the ballroom dance floor.
   
Millie Cao has danced through war, a global pandemic, and now, a mass shooting that took her friend’s life. Her formal training in ballroom dance alongside her husband and dance partner started 10 years ago when she was in her 50s, a journey documented in the 2019 Oscar-nominated short documentary “Walk, Run, Cha-Cha.” 
   
      But even before then, Cao had always loved to dance. In the Vietnam of her youth, she would sneak off to dance parties to forget about the war.  “Dance gives you a sense of freedom, a release from reality,” Cao said. 
   
      That’s part of the appeal of ballroom dancing. Its joyfulness and its accessibility attract a diverse group of Asian Americans who want to rumba away their worries. At Lai Lai Ballroom & Studio, according to Cao, the students come from China, Taiwan, Vietnam and many other countries. Her longtime dance teacher, Maksym Kapitanchuk, is from Ukraine. The cultural and language diversity is no problem because “we speak the same language of dance,” Cao said. 
   
      For years, she danced at Lai Lai Ballroom & Studio almost daily with her friend, Mymy Nhan, one of the victims of the shooting at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio. 
   
      Cao’s voice trembles when she talks about her friend. Everyone in the dance community is still in shock. Nhan was ever-present on the dance floor. “I don’t know how it will be like when I go back,” Cao said. 
   
      Not long after the fatal shooting, at a candlelight vigil in front of the Star Ballroom Dance Studio, dancers tearfully hugged each other in front of a line of pictures of the victims. Their grief was so fresh it was difficult to see. I had to close my eyes. In the darkness and quiet of our grief after a tragedy like this, how do we return to ourselves? Maybe it’s best, as poet Ocean Vuong says, to “fold the page so it points to the good part.”  
   
      The best version of this community shattered by gun violence is dancing — it has always been. Their bodies in motion are symbols of joyful rebellion and resilience. Cao said she will dance again. They all must get back on the dance floor. 
   
      They dance to forget, but also to remember.

      Chimpanzee teens may not be so different from the ones living in our homes, a new study says. 
   
      Except that your teen might be more impulsive.
   
      Researchers worked with 40 chimpanzees born in the wild while they were at a sanctuary in the Republic of Congo, playing games that tested the adolescent animals’ orientation toward risk-taking and impulsivity, according to the study published January 23 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General by the American Psychological Association.
   
      “Human adolescents are grappling with changing bodies and brains, and tend to be more impulsive, risk-seeking, and less able to regulate emotions than adults,” said lead study author Dr. Alexandra Rosati, associate professor of psychology and anthropology at the University of Michigan, via email. “Chimpanzees face many of the same kinds of challenges as humans as they grow up.” 
   
      The study described chimpanzees’ adolescence as a period from about ages 8 to 15 in a 50-year life span. Like young humans, they experience rapid hormone changes, new social bonds, increased aggression and a competition for social status. 
   
      Teen chimpanzees are overlooked in studies compared with infants and adults, said Dr. Aaron Sandel, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved in the current study.
   
      “For a while there was a pretty big gap in the literature on (chimpanzee) adolescents,” Sandel said, noting that researchers often don’t focus on this period. Scientists may avoid studying teen chimps because their own human experiences with teenage years are complicated, he said. 
   
      The new study found that adolescent chimpanzees were more likely to take risks in their games than their adult counterparts, but they just as likely would wait for a greater delayed reward. 
   
      But human teens are known to be more likely to take a smaller, more immediate reward, the study noted. 
   
      The chimpanzees underwent two tests with food rewards. These animals tended to dislike cucumbers while liking peanuts somewhat and loving bananas. 
   
      The first test involved a bit of a gamble. Both adult and teen chimpanzees were asked to choose between two containers: one that always had peanuts and another that had either the dreaded cucumber or treasured banana, the study said.
   
      The adolescent chimps were more likely to take a risk and go for the cucumber or banana container than the adults, the study said. Both groups showed similar negative reactions – such as moaning, whimpering, screaming and banging on the table – when they ended up with a cucumber. 
   
      The second test resembled a well-known one that has been given to human children. Chimpanzees had the option of having one banana slice immediately or waiting for a minute and then getting three slices. 
   
      Both adults and adolescents waited for the three slices at a similar rate, but the teens were more likely to throw a fit while they waited a minute, the study said. 
   
      In a similar test, human teens were more likely to take the smaller treat right away, according to the study.
   
      “Prior work indicates that chimpanzees are quite patient compared to other animals, and this study shows that their ability to delay gratification is already mature at a fairly young age, unlike in humans,” Rosati said.
   
      Sandel noted that it is important to be careful about comparing the experience of humans with other animals. While primates are our closest relatives, we are different species, he pointed out. 
   
      So how might a parent handle a teen who engages in risky behavior and hates to wait for a reward? 
   
      The first step is to understand what is going on in their developing brains, said Dr. Hina Talib, an adolescent medicine specialist and associate professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.
   
      “I think teenagers get a bad rap,” she said. “We often think of them as risky little devils. It does come from some element of truth.”
   
      The human teenage years are a time of explosive growth and development, she added. 
   
      Their brains are wired to seek out new experiences and information, which often means taking risks, Talib said. 
   
      At this time, they can try new things, build their ideas of who they are and try on different identities, said Tina Bryson, a Pasadena, California, therapist and author of “The Power of Showing Up: How Parental Presence Shapes Who Our Kids Become and How Their Brains Get Wired.”
 
      They learn from the information they gain, which can help them manage their behavior better – eventually, Talib said. 
   
      Families can encourage them to try new things, she said, while providing ground rules and support that will help keep them safe. 
   
      “We want you to go anywhere and do everything … Here is where we might step in or where we have house rules about something,’” Talib recommended that parents say. Your conversations should be “coming from a perspective of we are here as the floor, as the safety net as you go and have these amazing trapeze experiences.”
   
      And while their brains are growing a lot, not every area is able to be fully and optimally utilized at the same time. 
   
      Late middle and early high schoolers might be relying on the parts of the brain that rule emotion and reactivity, she added, while their decision-making and reasoning parts are busy growing.
   
      That doesn’t mean that teens are not capable of good decision-making and long-term planning, she added – you just have to help set them up for success. 
   
      “When things are calm, they are able to problem solve just as well as adults,” Talib said. Help them stay calm when they are in trouble and need to solve a problem and save the difficult conversations for when they are no longer stressed out, she added. 
   
      Instead of worrying about how to get rid of their impulsivity, Bryson recommended finding ways to help strengthen empathetic, thoughtful, and reasoned decision-making. 
   
      Encourage them to pause before acting and walk through the thinking process with them, she said. You can also talk through how you think through your own decisions, Bryson said.
   
      And while their brains may be undergoing changes, be sure to call out the things they are doing well, Talib said. 
   
      “The more you do that, the more you help them see themselves in a positive light, the more that gets hardwired in them,” she said, “and they are better able to face the world around them.”

      Phoebe Dynevor has confirmed that Daphne Bridgerton will not appear in Season 3 of Netflix’s “Bridgerton.” 
   
      “I’m just excited to watch as a viewer,” Dynevor told Screen Rant on Saturday, after confirming her character was “sadly not in season 3.”
   
      The door isn’t completely shut, though, with Dynevor also revealing that viewers may see Daphne again “in the future.” 
   
      CNN has reached out to Dynevor’s representatives and Netflix for further comment. 
   
      The saucy Shonda Rhimes-produced series debuted in 2020 and is based on Julia Quinn’s widely popular Regency-era book series. 
   
      “Working with someone like Shonda, who’s sort of pushing boundaries and doing exciting things, I just felt very safe and comfortable knowing that it was under her scope,” Dynevor told Harper’s Bazaar in 2021.
   
      Dynevor starred in the first season of “Bridgerton” alongside Regé-Jean Page, who played the swoon-worthy Duke of Hastings, Simon Basset. 
   
      Season 1 followed Daphne and Simon’s romance, and while Page did not return for the second season, Dynevor appeared in a smaller role in that season as the story centered around Daphne’s brother Anthony Bridgerton’s (Jonathan Bailey) own search for love. 
   
      Season 3 will focus on breakout star Nicola Coughlan’s role as Penelope Featherington and her romance with Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton). 
   
      A premiere date for Season 3 of “Bridgerton” has yet to be officially confirmed.

      The Women’s National Basketball Players Association said it will investigate basketball player Dearica Hamby’s claims that the Las Vegas Aces discriminated against her for getting pregnant.
   
      The Aces on Saturday traded Hamby to the Los Angeles Sparks. 
   
      “Being traded is a part of the business. Being lied to, bullied, manipulated, and discriminated against is not. I have had my character and work ethic attacked,” Hamby wrote in an Instagram post.
   
      Hamby signed a two-year contract extension with the Aces in June. She said she was accused of signing the extension while knowing she was pregnant, which she denied in her post.
   
      “This is false,” Hamby wrote. “I was told that I was ‘a question mark’ and that it was said that I said I would ‘get pregnant again’ and there was a concern for my level of commitment to the team.”
   
      Hamby, who announced her second pregnancy following the Aces 2022 WNBA Finals victory, added that the team thought she wasn’t going to be ready to play this season.
   
      “I planned to play this season, and I have expressed my desire to play this season,” Hamby said. “I have pushed myself throughout my entire pregnancy and have continued to work out (basketball included) on my own and with team staff - even on days where it was uncomfortable to walk, only to be inaccurately told that ‘I was not taking my workouts seriously.’”
   
      The WNBPA said in a statement Saturday that it would “seek a comprehensive investigation” to ensure Hamby’s rights under the league’s 2020 labor agreement as well as state and federal laws were not violated.
   
      The basketball association declined to comment on the allegations made by Hamby. CNN has reached out to the Aces for comment but did not immediately hear back.
   
      “The unprofessional and unethical way that I have been treated has been traumatizing,” Hamby said. “To be treated this way by an organization, BY WOMEN who are mothers, who have claimed to ‘be in these shoes,’ who preach family, chemistry, and women’s empowerment is disappointing and leaves me sick to my stomach. We fought for provisions that would finally support and protect player parents. This cannot now be used against me.”
   
      Hamby also expressed her excitement to join the Los Angeles Sparks. 
   
      “Thankful for the love!!! The best is yet to come! Looking forward to being in LA and can’t wait to get back on the court,” she said in a tweet. 
   
      Aces general manager Natalie Williams thanked Hamby for her eight years with the team when they announced the trade. 
   
      “Dearica has dedicated eight years of her career to this organization, and played a big role in our success since the team moved to Las Vegas,” Williams said in a statement. “We’re going to miss her as a teammate, and are grateful for all of her contributions to the Aces over the years.” 
   
      Hamby was drafted sixth overall in the 2015 WNBA Draft by the then-San Antonio Silver Stars. The Silver Stars moved to Las Vegas and became the Aces in 2018.
   
      The 29-year-old was named the WNBA Sixth Woman of the Year in 2019 and 2020. Hamby averaged 9.3 points and 7.1 rebounds for the Aces last season when they won their first WNBA championship.

      Music superstars are cashing in on a red-hot market. 
   
      Justin Bieber on Tuesday joined a growing list of iconic singers who have struck mammoth deals to sell their music catalogs — or, in some cases, their masters — for hundreds of millions of dollars.
   
      The song management company Hipgnosis said that it had acquired the rights to Bieber’s entire music catalog in an acquisition that “ranks among the biggest deals ever made for an artist under 70.” While the terms were not disclosed, Billboard reported that the price tag was a hulking $200 million.
   
      The news comes amid a broader trend — one that has been on the rise since Merck Mercuriadis founded Hipgnosis in 2018 and started buying up rights to legendary tracks. “What I wanted to do on behalf of the entire songwriter community is to really establish music as an asset class and create a market,” Mercuriadis said on Tuesday, equating the value of hit songs to gold or oil. “I wanted to demonstrate to the financial community that these great proven songs have very predictable, reliable income and therefore they are investable.”
   
      Mercuriadis has certainly helped lead the way in doing that. In the last few years, generational stars have inked nine-figure deals to hand over the rights to their catalogs. Bruce Springsteen sold his masters and publishing rights for a reported $500 million. Bob Dylan sold his catalog for a reported $300 million. And, younger artists have taken part in the action too, with singers such as John Legend and Iggy Azalea striking deals.
   
A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
 
      So why are these deals taking place in the last few years? For a few reasons.
   
      The streaming era has made music more valuable than ever. In the early aughts, Top 40 stations exerted a firm grip on music sales, sending fans to stores to purchase physical CDs of their favorite artists. Now, services like Spotify and Apple Music have revolutionized the music industry. And it is a business that is still on the advance.
   
      “The streaming market, especially if you think globally, has been steadily growing,” said Serona Elton, a former recording executive who now teaches as professor of music industry at the University of Miami Frost School of Music. “It has expanded into new markets as the costs of cellphones and wifi and cell services go down.”
   
      At the same time, the pandemic starved artists of touring revenue, forcing them to look at other moneymaking opportunities to expand their revenue stream. And the poor economic conditions created by the pandemic helped businesspeople realize that music is a “recession-proof asset,” Elton said, explaining, “Even if someone loses their job, they’re still listening to music.”
   
      Mercuriadis wholeheartedly agreed, saying, “Our emotional barometer as human beings is married to music. If we are living our best life, we are doing it to a soundtrack of music. And, equally, if we are being challenged, whether through a pandemic or inflation … we take comfort and escape with these songs. Songs are always part of our lives.”
   
      Finally, there is the more-recent TikTok factor. Short form video apps have accelerated the discovery of music as they send older tracks viral, driving streams and prompting spikes in downloads. Which is to say that songs of the past are experiencing a surge in new popularity.
   
      All of these factors are heating up the market. The Wall Street Journal reported that investors and music management companies “have been buying catalogs for as much as 30 times their average annual royalties.”
   
      Elton indicated that there is some risk for these artists selling to relatively new companies, such as Hipgnosis. Unlike legacy companies, these new businesses don’t have a long track record managing music. “Those of us who are not involved in the buying and selling, but are watching, are wondering: how is this going to play out over time?” Elton asked.
   
      But Mercuriadis argued that not only is he “managing these songs with great responsibility,” but his boutique-styled firm is a better steward than the legacy record labels. The labels, he said, often have a disparate set of goals, including creating new hits, which could distract them from the singular mission of managing older music. And, Mercuriadis noted, they manage massive libraries — not a narrower library of highly concentrated hits.
   
      “We are fully focused,” he said, “on managing the proven songs of the past.”

Wade, I can't stop thinking about how abortion changed my life","I still remember what it was like to be a young woman in a time when malfunctioning birth control could destroy one's future, writes Claudia Dreifus.

      On Friday, members of the right to life movement converged on Washington to mark the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. They were also celebrating last June’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision which abrogated it.  
   
      Among my friends – many of them veterans of the 1970s women’s rights campaigns – there’s no celebration.   
   
      The Roe decision of January 22, 1973, effectively legalized abortion throughout the United States. On a human level, it freed women of child-bearing age from the pain and danger of illegal abortion.   
   
      I went to college in the pre-Roe era of the early 1960s. I still remember what it was like to be a young woman in a time when malfunctioning birth control could destroy one’s future.  
   
      If that happened, illegal abortion—often in the underground world of criminality and with physical danger—was, for most of us, the only option.  
   
      Young people are sexual; young people get pregnant. In my college circle, one routinely heard the most horrific stories: operations in motel rooms, surgeries without anesthesia, abortionists who’d raped women seeking their services. Strange as it seems today: this was common. I had a friend who developed a pelvic infection after a back-alley abortion; she was rendered infertile.   
   
      I found myself pregnant in 1964. I was 19.  At first, I tried to self-abort. I failed. A friend of my mother’s connected me with a doctor in Pennsylvania.   
   
      On the way there, I felt terrified. What if he wasn’t a genuine physician? Would I contract an infection like my friend did? The thought that I might die kept repeating itself. As I drove through the bleak January landscape of rural Pennsylvania, I thought “Whatever the risks, you must do this. There’s no turning back.” 
   
      I’d drawn the lucky card. He turned out to be a real physician. I had the operation under anesthesia and with proper medication. He provided abortions because he believed in it, never charging more than $100. His community protected him.     
   
      At the end of a very long day, the doctor handed me a packet of birth control pills and said, “I don’t want to see you here again.” 
   
      At that moment, my life began anew. My future was mine. Today, I am a professor and a writer. None of that would have been possible if, as a teenager, I’d been forced to have a child.
   
      I’ve been reliving all of this since the Dobbs decision was announced. After Roe, so many of us believed that the era of backroom abortion was forever gone. We couldn’t imagine a society where rights, once granted, could be rescinded. 
   
      Yet here we are. The Guttmacher Institute, which collects data on reproductive matters, notes that since Dobbs was decided, some 24 states “have banned abortion or are likely to do so.” 
   
      Today, for the first time in half a century, one hears stories that echo experiences in the bad old days.   
   
      There are some differences, of course. Birth control options are more plentiful and widely accessible. And abortion is not entirely underground—it remains fully legal in more than half of all states and in the District of Columbia. But in those entities with new restrictions, health care for women—whether they seek an abortion or not—has been compromised. 
   
      In multiple states, doctors frankly are scared. State laws are changing. Lawyers and judges are making decisions about whether or not women – and in some cases young girls – can get the care their doctors know they need. Women are afraid of being investigated if they suffer a miscarriage. Politicians are advocating for abortion to be declared homicide. 
   
      Meanwhile, people who use the drug Methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain. The medication can induce miscarriage. Pharmacists fear that under post-Dobbs laws, they can be prosecuted for dispensing it.   
   
      The current landscape is especially disheartening for women of my generation and terrifying for women of childbearing age. But it’s also important to remember that the Roe decision of 1973 happened in a context of a wider societal expansion of women’s rights – and that the fight isn’t over. 
   
      In the 1970s, women were demanding equal access to male-dominated professions, an end to discrimination in education and, above everything, fairness from the law. In those years, I remember feeling that for women, it was a completely new chapter.    
   
      What Roe did was enable women to decide if and when they’d have children. That made the progress in work, education and personal relationships possible. It’s not a coincidence that recent research shows that women living in states with abortion bans contend with greater economic insecurity. 
   
      Does the Dobbs decision mean that the era of gender progress is now over? Not necessarily. Since Dobbs, state legislators, particularly in red states, have been falling over each other to enact new laws restricting access. But these moves are unpopular—especially with the millions of Americans who’ve benefited from legal abortion.  
   
      In five states, voters have defeated anti-abortion initiatives on the ballot.  
   
      This past November, the US Senate stayed Democratic, in part because of voter anger about abortion restrictions.    
   
      On a less formal level, as in the past, Americans are finding creative ways to circumvent the new limitations. In Texas, where a plethora of draconian laws have been enacted, many women are now going to Mexico for their gynecological care. In blue states, clinics have expanded to accommodate women from neighboring jurisdictions seeking abortions.  
   
      Of course, travel takes money. Many of the most restrictive states are among the poorest—Mississippi, Alabama, Oklahoma. NGOs like The Brigid Alliance and local pro-abortion funds provide travel expenses for women in need, but they can’t possibly meet the demand. Yet, they are an indispensable lifeline for as many as they are able to help – as is the corporate support available for some workers to travel out of state for abortions.
   
      As the fight continues, supporters of reproductive rights shouldn’t underestimate the determination of the anti-abortion community. Fifty years ago, they vowed to undo Roe v. Wade. For a half century, they marched and lobbied and saw to it that sympathetic conservatives were appointed to the Supreme Court.  
   
      And so, after decades of persistent work, their efforts bore fruit on June 24, 2022, when Justice Samuel Alito, writing on behalf of the six conservatives on the high court, opined, “we hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.” Writing for the seven-justice majority 50 years ago in Roe v. Wade, Justice Harry Blackmun found that the 14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides a fundamental “right to privacy” that protects the liberty of pregnant individuals to abort. 
   
      In the pro-choice moment from which Roe emerged, few thought that what happened in Dobbs could ever occur.  
   
      As a journalist, I try to avoid taking partisan positions. However, this issue is personal. I’m still haunted by that trip to Pennsylvania and how frightened I was. Today I have students and friends who are just beginning to move into their promising futures. It hurts to think that they might experience the same suffering that was so routine for my cohort.

      Head to Croatia’s northern Adriatic coast to discover some of the country’s most captivating regions. While Dubrovnik and other parts of southern Dalmatia get the lion’s share of attention, the Istrian peninsula and the neighboring islands and coastal ports of the Kvarner Gulf reveal other sides of Croatia’s rich culture and history. 
   
      In fact, there’s almost too much history to absorb – ancient Greeks and Romans, Venetians, Austro-Hungarians and Italians have all left their mark on the region’s architecture, the language and the food. 
   
      Ah, yes, the food. Truffles, olive oil and deliciously juicy oysters and mussels in Istria, fabulously fat langoustines in the Kvarner Gulf, gorgeously flavored lamb from Cres – and they all go beautifully with Istrian malvazija whites and teran reds, and a crisp white žlahtina from Krk. 
   
      When you’re not exploring ancient Roman ruins, Venetian villages and Habsburg towns, you’re basking on the hundreds of beaches that run along Istria’s long coastline to the neighboring Opatija Riviera and the shores of the Kvarner Gulf. Then hop on a ferry to roam the islands of the gulf – Krk, Cres, Lošinj and Rab – each accessible from the other, but all demanding a lingering look. 
   
      Work your way along the heart-shaped coast of the Istrian peninsula and you’ll wonder if you strayed across the Italian border by mistake. At various points in its long history, Istria was part of the Roman, Venetian and Habsburg empires – as well as Italy itself until after the Second World War – and you can see and taste this legacy everywhere. 
   
      In Pula at the peninsula’s southern tip, you’ll see one of the world’s best-preserved Roman amphitheaters, an atmospheric setting for concerts and the Pula Film Festival. Along the western coast is the impossibly beautiful port of Rovinj – or Rovigno, as it’s also known in this bilingual town. Its Venetian-style townhouses squeeze into narrow alleyways and tiny squares in the medieval old town where, at some point, you’ll find yourself on the cobbled steps of Grisia, one of its prettiest lanes. Taking one of the boats that regularly hop across to the small island of Sveta Katarina reveals the best view of the city.
   
      Head inland and you enter Istria’s world of hilltop medieval villages, rolling vineyards and truffle forests. Clinging to the hillside rising above vineyards is medieval Motovun, one of the most attractive bases from which to explore the area. From here it’s a short drive to Grožnjan, scene of summertime outdoor concerts and a place to browse the artists’ studios that have opened up over the decades. One of the most appealing ways to explore inland Istria is by hiking or cycling the Parenzana Trail, which follows the winding route of a disused railway line for about 80 miles. 
   
      When the Habsburgs discovered the mild climate of Opatija in the 19th century, they turned what had been a small fishing village on the Kvarner Gulf coast into the cradle of Croatian tourism. 
   
      Pastel-colored Belle Époque townhouses soon sprang up, many of which are now Opatija’s grand hotels. Park Angiolina near the seafront is a good introduction to this elegant town: a calm place of neat gardens, it’s also home to the 1844 Villa Angiolina, which now houses the Croatian Museum of Tourism. 
   
      There’s a small but fascinating collection of old photographs, vintage beachwear, posters, postcards and souvenirs going back more than 150 years. Look out for the park’s Wall of Fame showing giant paintings of previous visitors including Albert Einstein, James Joyce, Isadora Duncan, Gustav Mahler, Robert De Niro and the Lumière brothers.
   
      One of the most pleasurable ways to explore the town – and other parts of the Opatija Riviera – is to follow the Lungomare. This seafront promenade winds along the coast for nearly five miles from the fishing village of Volosko north of Opatija to the town of Lovran at the foot of the Učka Nature Park.
   
      Croatia’s biggest port is much more than just a jumping-off point for ferries to the islands of the Kvarner Gulf. This cosmopolitan city – 2020’s European Capital of Culture – is worth a lingering look. The Korzo is Rijeka’s main pedestrianized thoroughfare that’s the heart of the city, wandering past Habsburg-era townhouses and inviting café terraces. Then quirky PEEK&POKE Computer Museum offers a nostalgic look at vintage computers and other tech. 
   
      To go much further back in time, climb the 528 steps (or take the bus) to Trsat Castle, a 13th-century fortress on a bluff overlooking Rijeka, for glorious views of the city and the islands of the Kvarner Gulf. Trsat is also a place of pilgrimage – it’s home to the Church of Our Lady of Trsat and its neighboring park, with the Stations of the Cross along its footpaths and viewpoints.
   
      Tied with neighboring Cres for the biggest island in Croatia, and home to Rijeka Airport, Krk is attached to the mainland via a long bridge. Many visitors make a beeline for the lively beach resort of Baška, in a sheltered spot on Krk’s southern end – but there are many more beaches along the heavily indented coast. The village of Vrbnik is the place to try Krk’s indigenous white žlahtina wine. 
   
      Krk Town, the island’s largest settlement, reveals the region’s complex history within its old town, with its medieval fortress, Roman masonry, and Venetian houses on narrow cobblestoned alleyways. Look out for hiking trails that lead you to secluded pebbly beaches. 
   
      The long, thin island of Cres snakes along Krk’s west coast. This is a relatively unspoiled part of the Adriatic where sheep roam scrubby pastureland and produce some of Croatia’s tastiest lamb. You’ll find only a handful of villages, including the tiny Venetian-style Cres Town and the considerably smaller Osor, which dates back to Roman times, and whose lanes are filled with public art. 
   
      It’s an agreeably sleepy place, with quiet pebbly coves, an inland freshwater lake and the unexpected sight of a rescue center for griffon vultures in the northern village of Beli. When you’re not relaxing on the beaches at Valun or Lubenice, you can explore more than 60 miles of hiking trails that combine the wilderness of the hinterland with the shimmering beauty of the coast. 
   
      Attached to the southwestern side of Cres by a swing bridge, Lošinj dangles into the furthest reaches of the Kvarner Gulf. While it can take a bit of effort to get there, it’s infinitely worth it. 
   
      Smothered in wild herbs, Lošinj is soothingly fragrant, which you’ll discover as you walk or cycle along the pine-shaded paths that frame parts of the island. 
   
      Its two main villages, Mali Lošinj and Veli Lošinj, show their Venetian legacy; in fact, Veli Lošinj’s brightly colored houses resemble those on the Venetian island of Burano. In Mali Lošinj’s Museum of Apoxyomenos, you’ll get a taste of ancient history when you gaze at a bronze statue of a Greek athlete that had been lying undiscovered in the Adriatic for more than 2,000 years. 
   
      Back in the 19th centry, the Austro-Hungarian emperor Franz-Joseph spotted Lošinj’s potential as a place to unwind completely in that gorgeously scented air. One of his favorite spots was the misshapen Čikat Bay, whose clear waters fringed by Aleppo pines are as alluring as ever.
   
      Royalty of a different sort put the island of Rab on the map. In 1936, Britain’s short-reigning King Edward VIII and his then-lover Wallis Simpson stripped off and jumped naked into the waters off the Frkanj peninsula, sparking a tradition of naturism that has never left. Somehow this small island manages to pack in at least two dozen sandy beaches – quite a feat in a country that’s dominated by pebbly and rocky coves. Go hiking in the Lopar peninsula and you come across several of the loveliest.
   
      It wasn’t just the clear waters of Rab that enchanted the royal visitors. The exquisite and beautifully preserved medieval architecture of Rab Town, which includes four Romanesque campaniles, is just as enticing.

      Germany is set to send its sought-after Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine to help bolster the country’s war effort, Der Spiegel reported on Tuesday evening, attributing to unnamed sources. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has decided to deliver the battle tanks following “months of debate,” according to the German news outlet’s exclusive report.
   
      The German parliament is due to debate the contentious issue on Wednesday morning. Deciding to send them would be a landmark moment in the West’s support for Kyiv that follows days of intense pressure on Berlin from some of its NATO partners.
   
      CNN reached out to the German government for comment on Tuesday evening but has not received a response. 
   
      The report comes shortly after United States officials revealed on Tuesday that the Biden administration is finalizing plans to send US-made tanks to Ukraine. Germany had indicated to the US last week that it would not send its Leopard tanks unless the US also agreed to send its own M1 Abrams tanks.
   
      Sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine would provide Kyiv’s forces with a modern and powerful military vehicle ahead of a potential Russian spring offensive. It would also come as a blow to the Kremlin, which has seen a growing campaign to equip Ukrainian troops with high-tech fighting systems as Russia’s ground war nears the one-year mark.
   
      Germany had resisted a growing drumbeat of Western pressure to ship some of the tanks to Ukraine, with new German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius repeatedly calling for more time and insisting that the move would come with pros and cons for Berlin.
   
      Warsaw raised the stakes on Tuesday when it formally asked permission to send its own Leopards, a move Berlin had previously said it wouldn’t block.
   
      Several European countries also own some Leopards, and Poland had led an effort to re-export those to Ukraine even if Germany was not on board. But the decision of Scholz and Pistorius was considered crucial because the tanks are German-made and Germany is usually in control of their export and re-export.
   
      A Polish official told CNN Tuesday that to their knowledge, Berlin had not yet formally notified Warsaw about a decision to allow the Leopards to be sent to Ukraine.
   
      The German army has 320 Leopard tanks in its possession but does not reveal how many would be battle ready, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defense previously told CNN.
   
      Several high-tech fighting systems have been pledged to Ukraine since the turn of the year amid a renewed wave of Western military aid. The US finalized a huge military aid package for Ukraine totaling approximately $2.5 billion worth of weaponry last week, including Stryker combat vehicles for the first time, while the United Kingdom and a number of EU countries have agreed to send tanks.
   
      Pistorius, who became Germany’s defense minister on Thursday, saw his first days in the job dominated by the efforts of key allies to join that trend by shipping Leopards into Ukraine. Germany in turn looked to secure guarantees that the US would send its own tanks too.
   
      But frustration from some leaders spilled into the open after a Berlin summit wrapped last Friday without a deal to send Leopards, with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki accusing Germany of “wasting time” by failing to come to a decision.
   
      The Leopard 2 tank would be a powerful fighting vehicle for Ukraine’s battlegrounds.
   
      Each tank contains a 120mm Smoothbore gun, and a 7.62mm machine gun; it can reach speeds of 70 km per hour (44 mph), or 50 kmph when off-road, making maneuverability one of its key features. And there is all-around protection from threats, including improvised explosive devices, mines or anti-tank fire, according to its German manufacturer, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann.
   
      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly pleaded for countries to stop squabbling over whether to send the tanks.
   
      “We have talked hundreds of times about the shortage of weapons. We cannot go only on motivation,” he said during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos last week.
   
      In an apparent swipe at Germany’s stalling, Zelensky added: “There are moments when there is no need to hesitate. When people say – I’ll give you tanks if someone else does.”
   
      Russia had meanwhile sought to threaten Germany as it deliberated. Asked during a regular press briefing about Moscow’s reaction if Berlin approved sending tanks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the relations between the two countries “are already at a fairly low point,” adding there is currently “no substantive dialogue with Germany or with other EU and NATO countries.”
   
      “Of course, such deliveries do not bode well for the future of relations. They will leave an imminent trace,” Peskov said.
   
      Previous military aid, like the American HIMARS rocket system, has been vital in helping Ukraine make a series of successful counter-offensives in recent months.

      UPS reported a record profit for 2022 as its revenue reached $100 billion for the first time since its founding in 1907.
   
      The company said Tuesday it earned $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter, little changed from a year ago and slightly better than analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting. But it was enough to lift full-year earnings to $11.3 billion, up from what had already been a record, of $10.7 billion, a year ago. 
   
      The company has enjoyed three years of rapid growth as online shopping surged during the pandemic. In 2019, the year before the pandemic began, UPS reported revenue of $74.4 billion, and adjusted income of $6.5 billion. 
   
      That means annual revenue is up 11%, on average, each year since the start of the pandemic, while earnings rose about 20% a year.
   
      That’s good news as UPS is a proxy for both domestic and global economies, carrying an estimated 2% of the world’s gross domestic product and 6% of the US GDP each day. 
   
      But those three years of double-digit growth may be in the past, or at least on hold. UPS is one of several companies, from pharmaceuticals to online retailers, who experienced a Covid-19 boom in business that may be tailing off.
   
      Revenue in the fourth quarter fell 3% to $27 billion, even as full-year revenue climbed 4.5% to the $100.3 billion. And the company warned it expects slightly lower revenue and tighter profit margins for 2023.
   
      Still shares of UPS were up about 5% in midday trading on its solid earnings report.
   
      With fears that 2023 could bring a global or US recession, there had been something of an overhang on the stock, despite the strong recent earnings. UPS shares are down about 20% over the last twelve months, through Monday’s close.
   
      Also overhanging the stock are concerns that UPS could face a strike later this year by the Teamsters union, which represents more than 325,000 UPS employees, making it the nation’s largest unionized workforce of any business. The union contract expires on July 31.
   
      UPS CEO Carol Tome tried to downplay the strike threat when asked about it during a call with analysts Tuesday.
   
      “The Teamsters have been part of the UPS family for more than 100 years. So over 10 decades, we’ve negotiated many, many contracts. This is not our first rodeo,” she said. She insisted the company will be be to find a common ground in negotiations that will be a win for the company, its employees and its customers.
   
      “We’re not far apart,” she said. “We’re going to do the right thing for our people.”
   
      Still, the existing contract was put in places despite opposition from the majority of rank-and-file who voted in the ratification election. Opposition to that contract and ratification vote was a major issue in the election of Sean O’Brien as its new president. While O’Brien says the union doesn’t want a strike he says its membership is prepared to do what it takes to get a better contract this time around.
   
      “Do our members wake up every day wanting a strike. I’d say no. But are they fed up? Yes they’re fed up,” O’Brien told CNN Business in September. “Whether or not there is a strike, that’s totally up to the company. We’re going to utilize as much leverage as we can to get our members the contract they deserve.”

      The digital media conglomerate BDG, which houses brands such as Elite Daily and Bustle, announced on Wednesday that it will slash its workforce by 8% and shutter the recently relaunched news and gossip website Gawker.
   
      In an email to employees, chief executive Bryan Goldberg said the company is “facing a surprisingly difficult” first quarter of 2023 and had made the decision to “reprioritize” some of its investments that “better position the company for the direction we see the industry moving.”
   
      Those changes, he said, would result in laying off 8% of the media company’s full-time staff.
   
      “The most noticeable change you will see today is that BD will be suspending operations of Gawker,” Goldberg wrote. “We are proud of the site that [editor-in-chief Leah Finnegan] and her team built. Gawker published a lot of brilliant pieces in these nearly two years. But in this new reality, we have to prioritize our better monetized sites. It’s a business decision, and one that, reluctantly, must be made.”
   
      Finnegan tweeted Wednesday morning that Gawker had “an incredible 1.5 years” but that “BDG has decided it is done with Gawker 2.0.”
   
      “Can’t say enough about how proud I am of the site and all the brilliant people who worked to create it, and what a staggering shame this is. I had an absolute blast, and I love you,” Finnegan wrote.
   
      BDG purchased the rights to Gawker in a 2018 bankruptcy auction after the gossip website was forced to shut down after losing a massive lawsuit from former wrestler Hulk Hogan. The company officially relaunched the website in the summer of 2021.
   
      In recent months, the media and technology sectors have taken a battering as advertisers tighten spending amid economic uncertainty.
   
      Across the news industry, layoffs have been rampant. CNN, NBC News, MSNBC, Vox Media, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed, Dotdash Meredith, Gannett and other news organizations have cut their workforces in recent months. And companies that haven’t laid off staffers have taken strong measures to reduce spending.
   
      Technology companies Google, Meta, Amazon, Spotify, and Microsoft have announced layoffs in recent months.
   
      And Entertainment giants, such as Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN’s parent company) and Paramount Global, have also trimmed their workforces.

      Southwest of the city of Bakhmut, Ukrainian soldiers Andriy and Borisych live in a candle-lit bunker cut into the frozen earth. For several weeks they have been confronting hundreds of fighters belonging to the Russian private military contractor Wagner throwing themselves against Ukrainian defenses.
   
      Disguised in a balaclava, Andriy recounts one seemingly endless firefight when they came under attack by a flood of Wagner fighters.
   
      “We were fighting for about 10 hours in a row. And it wasn’t like just waves, it was uninterrupted. So it was just like they didn’t stop coming.”
   
      Their AK-47 rifles became so hot from constant firing, Andriy says, that they had to keep changing them. 
   
      “It was about 20 soldiers on our side. And let’s say 200 from their side,” he says.
   
      The Wagner way of war is to send a first wave of attackers that mainly comprises raw recruits straight out of Russian prisons. They know little of military tactics and are poorly equipped. Most just hope that if they survive their six-month contract they can go home rather than back to a cell
   
      “They make the group – let’s say from 10 soldiers – reach 30 meters, then they start digging in to keep the position,” Andriy says of Wagner.
   
      Another group follows, he says, to claim another 30 meters. “That’s how, step by step, (Wagner) is trying to move forward, while they lose a lot of people in the meantime.” 
   
      Only when the first wave is exhausted or cut down do Wagner send in more experienced combatants, often from the flanks, in an effort to overrun Ukrainian positions. 
   
      Andriy says facing the assault was a frightening and surreal experience. 
   
      “Our machine gunner was almost getting crazy, because he was shooting at them. And he said, I know I shot him, but he doesn’t fall. And then after some time, when he maybe bleeds out, so he just falls down.”
   
      Andriy compares the battle to a scene out of a zombie movie. “They’re climbing above the corpse of their friends, stepping on them,” he says. 
   
      “It looks like it’s very, very likely that they are getting some drugs before attack,” he says, a claim that CNN has not been able independently to verify. 
   
      Even after the first waves were eliminated, the attack continued as the Ukrainian defenders say they ran out of bullets and found themselves surrounded.
   
      “The problem was that they went around us. And that’s how they surrounded us. They came from the other side. We didn’t expect them to come from there.
   
      “We were shooting until the last bullet, so we threw all the grenades we had and left only me and a few guys. We were helpless in that situation.”
   
      They were lucky. Held off until the last moment, the Ukrainian fighters say, Wagner withdrew at the end of the day.
   
      Andriy’s account of Wagner’s approach matches that of a Ukrainian intelligence report obtained by CNN last week. 
   
      According to that report, if Wagner forces succeed in taking a position, artillery support allows them to dig foxholes and consolidate their gains. According to Ukrainian intercepts, coordination between Wagner and the Russian military is often lacking. 
   
      CNN reached out to Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin this week about allegations of abuse in the company’s ranks. 
   
      Prigozhin responded in a statement that was largely sarcastic in tone via his press service, calling CNN an “open enemy” before insisting Wagner is an “exemplary military organization that complies with all the necessary laws and rules of modern wars.” 
   
      As he speaks to CNN, the fields above Andriy’s bunker reverberate to almost constant shelling. The whine of outgoing artillery is followed by a distant thud a few seconds later and a few kilometers away. 
   
      The chatter of small arms fire erupts as Ukrainian soldiers detect what they believe to be a Russian drone and try to bring it down. 
   
      Andriy’s unit says it captured one Wagner fighter, whose story is as tragic as Wagner’s tactics are primitive and brutal. 
   
      According to a recording of the man being questioned, the man is an engineer but had taken to selling drugs to make some money. He volunteered to join Wagner in the belief it would expunge his criminal record so that his daughter would have fewer problems following her dream to become a lawyer. 
   
      “And when did you realize, you are just meat?” Andriy asks him. 
   
      “At the first combat mission. They brought us to the frontline on December 28. They sent us forward last night.” 
   
      “How many people were in the group?” 
   
      “Ten,” he answers. 
   
      Andriy says he had told the engineer: “Obviously, you know that you will be killed (in battle). But you’re afraid to fight for your freedom in your country.”
   
      “He said, ‘Yes, this is true. We’re afraid of Putin.’” 
   
      Andriy contrasted Russian President Vladimir Putin with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who not so long ago was the country’s leading comedian. 
   
      “Our advantage is that yes, we do, we really can choose the guy whom the [Russians] call a clown. But as we can see, now, this guy is really the leader of the free world, at the moment, on our planet. 
   
      Andriy, who is from the southwestern city of Odesa and joined up within days of Russia’s invasion, says that no matter how many more fighters are sent to storm their positions, they will resist.  
   
      “Most of my guys, they are volunteers. They had (a) good business, they had (a) good job, they had a good salary, but they came to fight for their homeland. And it makes a great difference,” he says. 
   
      “This is the war for freedom. It’s not even the war between Ukraine and Russia. This is a war between a regime and democracy.”

      Here’s something you don’t see everyday. Pet fish playing a video game in Japan managed to log on to the Nintendo Switch store, change their owner’s avatar, set up a Pay Pal account and rack up a credit card bill. 
 
      And it was all seemingly livestreamed, in real time, on the internet.
   
      The fish in question belong to a YouTuber known as Mutekimaru, whose channel is popular with the gaming community for its videos featuring groups of tetra fish that “play” video games.
   
      Mutekimaru had previously installed sophisticated motion detection tracking software in fish tanks, enabling the fish to remotely control a Nintendo Switch console. 
   
      But the technology, and the fishes’ apparent mastery of it, led to an unexpected turn of events earlier this month while Mutekimaru was live-streaming a game of Pokémon.
   
      Mutekimaru had stepped away for a break when the game crashed due to a system error and the console returned to the home screen.
   
      But the fish carried on swimming, like fish tend to do, and seemingly continued to control the console remotely from their tank.
   
      During the next seven hours, the fish reportedly managed to change the name of their owner’s Switch account before twice logging into the Nintendo store, where users can purchase games and other downloadable content. 
   
      They also managed to “check” legal terms and conditions, downloaded a new avatar and even set up a PayPal account from the Switch – sending an email out to their owner in the process, video from the livestream appeared to show. 
   
      But things didn’t end there. The fish were also seen adding 500 yen ($4) to Mutekimaru’s Switch account from his credit card during the livestream  – exposing his credit card details in the process, the YouTuber revealed in a follow-up video about the episode. 
   
      By this point, thousands of comments were streaming in as viewers watched the unintended takeover being livestreamed on the channel, and the incident went viral on Twitter, where thousands of Japanese users shared their amusement. 
   
      Mutekimaru later said that he had contacted Nintendo to explain what happened and asked for a refund of his 500 yen. 
   
      Nintendo declined to comment to CNN, citing customer confidentiality.

      Last week, K-pop singer Danielle Marsh asked her online fans what they were doing for Chinese New Year. A profuse apology followed two days later, in which she promised to “try to be more careful” and acknowledged the “hurt” she had caused.
   
      Her crime? The “Chinese” that preceded “New Year.”
   
      A longstanding debate over the usage of “Chinese New Year” versus “Lunar New Year” has reignited in recent weeks as people around the world celebrated the holiday, with brands and celebrities coming under fire for using either phrase.
   
      Advocates of “Lunar New Year” point out that the holiday is celebrated by various countries, each with their own specific rituals, foods, histories and nuances – which are flattened and erased by an erroneous reference to “Chinese New Year.”
   
      Marsh pointed to this in her apology, saying her original wording had been “inappropriate” given the holiday’s regional diversity.
   
      A number of organizations, including the Associated Press Stylebook used by many newsrooms, recommend using Lunar New Year instead of Chinese New Year.
   
      However, the usage of “Lunar New Year” has proved equally controversial for critics in China, many of whom argue that the holiday has its roots in the Chinese lunisolar calendar and China’s historical influence on countries in the region.
   
      That has left many brands and public figures caught in the middle, trying to tiptoe their way through the holiday without being lambasted by either side – often unsuccessfully.
   
      In one notable instance, the British Museum shared details about a show by a traditional Korean music group. “Join us in celebrating Korean Lunar New Year with magical performances,” it wrote on Twitter on January 12.
   
      A barrage of angry tweets followed. “It’s called Chinese New Year,” one Twitter user replied.
   
      The British Museum subsequently deleted its tweet. On January 22, the first day of the holiday, it shared a new post with the image of a Chinese painting. “Happy New Year!” it wrote, before repeating the greeting in Chinese.
   
      Lunar New Year marks the beginning of the lunisolar calendar, with festivities often lasting for 15 days or more. It’s one of the most important holidays of the year for many participants, with families coming together – similar to Thanksgiving in the United States.
   
      It is celebrated across Asia, including in the Korean Peninsula, where the holiday is called Seollal; in Vietnam, where it’s called Tết; in China, where it’s also known as the Spring Festival; and in other countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and more.
   
      And while many of these regional celebrations have roots in the Chinese Spring Festival – for instance, Tết was widely popularized in Vietnam during the period it was under Chinese rule – they have since evolved to reflect each country’s cultures, beliefs and cuisines.
   
      This variety is largely why advocates of “Lunar New Year” have urged the transition away from “Chinese New Year.” And while the debate isn’t new – celebrities have been coming under fire for saying one or the other for years – it seems to have gained particular traction this year.
   
      Maggie Ying Jiang, an associate professor at the University of Western Australia who studies cross-cultural communication and consumer nationalism, pointed to the British Museum’s tweet as the catalyst. It had been reposted on Chinese social media, sparking a heated debate with related hashtags attracting hundreds of millions of views.
   
      “This reflects two issues: cultural identity conflicts among Asian nations, particularly between China and Korea in this case, (and the) current geopolitical environment,” she said.
   
      Besides the push for greater inclusivity, the adoption of “Lunar New Year” demonstrates the “ongoing efforts” by China’s neighbors to establish and promote their own independent cultural identities, she added.
   
      These tensions can be seen in other recent cultural conflicts, she said. For instance, China and South Korea have engaged in numerous feuds over items claimed by both countries, such as kimchi, the iconic fermented vegetable dish, and the traditional hanbok dress.
 
      It’s no coincidence these spats took place as relations between the two nations frayed, with recent years seeing political disagreements, economic retaliation and even tit-for-tat travel restrictions during the pandemic.
   
      But the campaign for a more inclusive name hasn’t been welcomed everywhere. In China, the holiday remains firmly “Chinese” – even when referring to its celebrations in other countries.
   
      State-run news agency Xinhua, for instance, hailed the celebration of “Chinese Lunar New Year” in Myanmar, Malaysia and Japan, emphasizing the use of “Chinese red” in decorations. 
   
      The same sentiment seems widely shared on China’s heavily censored social media, with some posts furiously railing against the alternative phrasing.
   
      “We can see that the ‘Lunar New Year,’ led by Koreans, is an ideological attack on Chinese culture by Western countries,” read one popular post on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. 
   
      Another post scoffed that by the same logic, Christmas should be renamed to reflect each country that celebrates it – such as “American Christmas” or “German Christmas.”
   
      Some people seemed more baffled than anything by the whole fuss. “But this is Chinese New Year, I really don’t understand why Koreans are so sensitive,” one Weibo user remarked. “Is it possible that they really think the Spring Festival belongs to South Korea?”
   
      Jiang, the professor, pointed to surging nationalism as a potential factor driving these strong reactions.
   
      Nationalism has risen in recent years under Chinese leader Xi Jinping and dominated Weibo. Many public intellectuals, scholars, lawyers and feminist activists have been viciously attacked or silenced for comments deemed “unpatriotic.”
   
      The trend accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic, said Jiang. She added that China’s “century of humiliation,” during which the Qing Empire and later the Republic of China were laid low by foreign powers, “serves as the basis for Chinese nationalism and (is) deeply rooted in the society.”
   
      However, this has made life far more difficult for brands, foreign politicians and public figures trying to navigate cultural sensitivities in China and overseas. Last July, for instance, Dior faced protests outside its Paris store after Chinese social media users claimed a skirt had appropriated a centuries-old traditional garment.
   
      With shrinking room for error, some are doing their best to appease all sides.
   
      “On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating Korean New Year a very happy and healthy Year of the Rabbit,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wrote in a statement on Sunday. 
   
      Then, in a separate statement, he wished the Vietnamese community a happy Tết Nguyên Đán.
   
      A third statement followed. “新年快樂,” he wrote, before repeating the Chinese greeting for “Happy New Year” in romanized Mandarin and Cantonese.

      Belarusian-born Aryna Sabalenka defeated Elena Rybakina in three sets to win a thrilling women’s Australian Open final Saturday, becoming the first player competing under a neutral flag to secure a grand slam. 
   
      Amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, tournament organizer Tennis Australia required Russian and Belarusian players to compete as neutrals. 
   
      Outplayed in the opening set, Sabalenka came from behind to overpower the reigning Wimbledon champion 4-6 6-3 6-4 in a remarkable turnaround in Melbourne. 
   
      Breaking Rybakina’s serve in the seventh game of a tense third set proved to be the crucial breakthrough for the fifth seed, whose venomous serve and intense groundstrokes ultimately paved the way for her success. 
   
      A nervous start from Sabalenka – she made five double faults and won only four points on the second serve in the first set – made it seem as if it would be a routine second grand slam for Rybakina as she secured the first set in 34 minutes. 
   
      But Sabalenka found accuracy as well as power in the second and third sets, with Rybakina faltering at crucial stages. The Russian-born Kazakh, who is also a big hitter, saw off three championship points but sent a forehand long on the fourth. Sabalenka fell to the ground, reduced to tears on wining her maiden major. 
   
      She celebrated by climbing to the players’ box where her coach, Anton Dubrov, could be seen sobbing into a towel. 
   
      “I’m still shaking and super nervous,” she told the spectators in her on-court speech before the presentation. 
   
      On receiving the trophy from Billie Jean King, Sabalenka thanked the American great for her pioneering work for the women’s game, and went on to thank her team, whom she described as the “craziest on tour.”
   
      “We’ve been through a lot of downs last year,” she said. “We worked so hard, you guys deserve this trophy, it’s more about you than about me. Thank you so much for everything you do for me. I love you.”
   
      Minsk-born Sabalenka was competing in her first grand slam final, having previously lost three major semifinals. Serving first, she opened the match with a double fault as nerves clearly played a part on an occasion such as this. She later admitted that she tactically didn’t “play my best” in the first set. 
   
      In the second set she targeted the Rybakina forehand and broke early for a 3-1 lead. When Rybakina threatened to break back immediately, as she had done in the first set, Sabalenka held firm, overcoming another double fault to further extend her lead at 4-1 before going on to clinch the set with an ace. 
   
      After an impressive second set from Sabalenka, the match entered a tense third set decider. Initially the pair went toe-to-toe, both having the bravery to go for their shots, to maintain the power, but it was Sabalenka who eventually broke through, ending an entertaining final with 17 aces and 51 winners. 
   
      “I need a few more days to realize what happened,” Sabalenka told Eurosport. 
   
      “I’m just super happy and proud. There’s so many things in my head. I’m not on this planet right now. It’s kind of relief, I’ve been in the top 10 but I didn’t have a grand slam trophy yet and it’s been really tough to get it, every slam was super emotional.
   
      “It’s relief, it’s a joy, I’m just proud of myself, of everyone.”
   
      Asked how she would celebrate, Sabalenka said, laughing: “Probably eating everything that I couldn’t this week.”
   
      Rybakina was ranked 25th in the world coming into this tournament – a position which belies her talent and success – and she began the tournament playing on the outside courts.
   
      Her failure to break into the top 10 stemmed mainly from the fact that ranking points from last year’s Wimbledon were removed because of the tournament’s decision to ban Russians and Belarusians from playing.
   
      Reaching the final in Melbourne – where she defeated three former grand slam winners along the way in Iga Światek, Jelena Ostapenko and Victoria Azarenka – will no doubt help her rise up the rankings. 
   
      “Hopefully we are going to have many more battles,” Rybakina told Sabalenka during the trophy presentation. “It was a good year for me and hopefully next year I am going to have the same result and (do) even better.”

Mo Salah was Liverpool’s figurehead, his goalscoring prowess the capstone of a team accustomed to winning trophies.
   
      But, like the rest of his team, Salah is “suffering” this season because of the constant disruption to Liverpool’s attack, scoring just once in his last six appearances, manager Jurgen Klopp said in a press conference on Friday.
   
      Injuries to key players – Salah has played just 343 minutes alongside likely fellow starters Luis Diaz and Darwin Núñez – have only heightened the loss of Sadio Mané to Bayern Munich last season, breaking up Liverpool’s cohesive offensive unit.
   
      “It was a well-drilled machine the front three; everything was clear what we were doing,” Klopp said. “Everyone suffers, that’s clear. It is specific, offensive play that requires a lot of work and a lot of information, and not always obvious information.”
   
      This season, Salah has scored seven goals in 19 Premier League games, unlike in 2021/22 when he contributed 23 goals and won the Golden Boot. 
   
      Lying in ninth in the Premier League having scored fewer goals, conceded more, and won fewer points than any of the previous seven seasons at this stage under Klopp’s tenure, Liverpool’s problems run deeper than just Salah’s misfiring form.
   
      “Mo has scored hundreds of goals in recent years and when you don’t score the first thing people think about is that, but that is not our problem at the moment,” Klopp added.
   
      “We started the season with Harvey [Elliott] in the half position, with Hendo [Jordan Henderson] it is different, and now it is Naby [Keïta]. So things are different all the time but usually you have a real basis to build on and that is what we don’t have.”
   
      As Klopp seeks to kickstart Liverpool’s floundering season, he hopes that January signing Cody Gakpo can offer an alternative offensive option.
   
      “Now we have Cody [Gakpo], obviously a really important asset, a connector; he can play the wing and the centre as well,” Klopp said.
   
      Liverpool next take to the field against Brighton in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday.

      More than $60 billion may have been paid out in fraudulent unemployment insurance benefits during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a report released Monday by the US Government Accountability Office.
   
      The watchdog agency, however, warned that the estimate has limitations and should be interpreted with caution. The actual amount of pandemic unemployment benefits fraud may be “substantially higher.”
   
      At least $4.3 billion in jobless benefits fraud has been formally determined by state unemployment agencies, while at least $45 billion in payments have been flagged for potential fraud by the US Department of Labor’s Office of Inspector General, the GAO said. But this cannot be interpreted as the extent of the problem, it continued.
   
      The GAO report provides the latest insight into the numerous schemes to steal money from a range of hastily implemented pandemic relief programs. 
   
      It comes a week before newly in power House Republicans plan to launch their first investigation into fraud in pandemic assistance efforts. The House Oversight Committee said it will hold a hearing on “the rampant waste of taxpayer dollars in COVID relief programs” on February 1.
   
      The committee, chaired by Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, sent letters to the Department of Labor and its inspector general’s office, as well as the state labor departments in California, New York and Pennsylvania, asking for more information about fraudulent jobless benefits claims.
   
      “We owe it to Americans to identify how hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars spent under the guise of pandemic relief were lost to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement,” Comer said.
   
      The Department of Labor said it received Comer’s letter and is reviewing it.
   
      Fraud within the nation’s unemployment system skyrocketed after Congress enacted a historic expansion of the program to help Americans deal with the economic upheaval sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. State unemployment agencies were overwhelmed with record numbers of claims and relaxed some requirements in an effort to get the money out the door quickly to those who had lost their jobs. 
   
      States and Congress subsequently tightened their verification requirements in an attempt to combat the fraud, particularly in a new temporary program that allowed freelancers, gig workers and others to collect benefits for the first time.
   
      A key component of the relief effort was a federal weekly supplement for out-of-work Americans. The jobless received a $600-a-week boost from April through July of 2020. Congress then revived the enhancement in late December 2020 but reduced it to $300 a week. That supplement expired in September 2021, though many states led by Republicans and one with a Democratic governor ended it earlier.
   
      Lawmakers also created two other major measures to aid the jobless. The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program provided payments for freelancers, the self-employed, independent contractors and certain people affected by the outbreak, while the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program extended payments for those who exhausted their regular state benefits. Those programs also ended by September 2021.
   
      A total of about $878 billion in pandemic unemployment benefits were paid from April 2020 through September 2022, the GAO said, citing Department of Labor data.
   
      The Department of Labor has taken steps to address fraud risks, including issuing guidance, providing funding to states and deploying teams to recommend improvements to state unemployment insurance programs, the GAO said. But the office described the approach as “ad hoc.”
   
      The department has yet to develop an anti-fraud strategy based on GAO’s Fraud Risk Framework and to address six recommendations the office made in October 2021. These include identifying, assessing the impact of and prioritizing unemployment insurance fraud risks.
   
      The GAO added the unemployment insurance system to its high-risk list last June.
   
      In response, the Department of Labor said that it proceeded with implementing the recommendations during 2022. It is also working to develop an unemployment insurance fraud risk profile in accordance with the GAO’s framework.
   
      But the department also noted that it has an unemployment insurance integrity strategic plan, and many of the strategies address identified fraud risks.
   
      The GAO report’s estimate is higher than one released by the Labor Department’s Office of Inspector General in September. The latter said that $45.6 billion in pandemic unemployment benefits may have been fraudulently paid in four high-risk areas between March 2020 and April 2022.
   
      The inspector general looked at payments tied to Social Security numbers of people who filed in multiple states, who were deceased, who were federal prisoners and who used suspicious email accounts in their claims. 
   
      Also, the inspector general’s office said that the Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration, which oversees the unemployment insurance program, had not implemented the office’s previous recommendations to thwart fraud in these areas. In a response, the department said it continues to “actively and aggressively address fraud” in unemployment compensation programs.
   
      In its semiannual report to Congress in 2021, the inspector general’s office said that at least $87 billion in jobless benefits may have been paid improperly, with a significant portion due to fraud – based on a historical improper payment rate of 10% or higher. But the office noted that its audits and investigations indicate the improper payment rate will ultimately turn out to be much higher than 10%.

President Joe Biden offered an olive branch to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Thursday as he gave an interfaith and bipartisan address to the National Prayer Breakfast, remarks on Capitol Hill that come amid pressing issues including the debt limit, a national conversation on justice and policing and congressional investigations into his administration. 
   
      Biden’s remarks on respect and the hard work of loving one’s neighbor were given to a smaller group of lawmakers than previous breakfasts as organizers sought to return the event to its original purpose: An intimate meeting of lawmakers, faith leaders and the president of the United States gathering in fellowship to pray for the country and guidance to lead the nation.
   
      Recalling a time in Congress when lawmakers would “argue like hell” with each other and then break bread, Biden said, “I don’t know how we do that anymore. But we have to. We have to start treating each other in ways different than we have, in my humble opinion.”
   
      He continued, “Let’s just sort of, kind of join hands again a little bit. Let’s start treating each other with respect. That’s what Kevin and I are going to do, not a joke. Very good meeting yesterday. I think we got to do it across the board. Doesn’t mean we’ve got to agree – fight like hell – but let’s treat each other with respect.” 
   
      Biden and McCarthy huddled for over an hour on Wednesday in the Oval Office on the debt limit and federal spending. The meeting, as predicted, did not bear fruit, but McCarthy signaled optimism that it was a “good first start” and both he and Biden can reach consensus “long before” the United States reaches default. Both sides, however, remain dug in on their respective positions. 
   
      Biden called on Americans more broadly to “look out for one another” as he recalled the loss of the last several years, pointing to the pandemic, record extreme weather, mass shootings, and the death of Tyre Nichols. 
   
      “In our politics and our lives, we too often see each other as opponents and not competitors. We see each other as enemies, not neighbors. And as tough as these times have been, if we look closer, we see the strength, the determination that has long defined America,” he said. 
   
      He called on Americans to follow a “ministry of presence” by “being there for one another… not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as who we really are: As fellow Americans.” 
   
      As Biden reflected on the concept of loving thy neighbor, he said it was “the hardest one.” 
   
      “At least it’s hardest here. Didn’t used to be as hard. I’ve been here a long time, but it seems to be getting harder. It’s easy to say – it’s hard to do. But in that commandment lies the essence of faith: Loving our neighbors is also part of the essence of the American promise. A promise that comes with a new Congress that is more diverse and more different and more religions, more races, more – more diversity than ever before in our history,” he said. 
   
      He thanked the members present at the breakfast as he applauded a recent effort to make it a “more intimate gathering” and “bring it back to its roots” as organizers have sought to depoliticize the event.
   
      While hundreds of people were in attendance at a Hilton, from which the program was livestreamed, the event was meant to be a contrast to some of the more political and contentious national prayer breakfasts of the Trump years just as Biden heads into a tumultuous few months of congressional investigations and debt ceiling standoff. 
   
      Presidential remarks have largely focused on faith and prayer, but former President Donald Trump used multiple appearances at the breakfast to call out his political rivals. 
   
      In 2020, Trump took veiled shots at then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Mitt Romney, who had joined Democrats one day prior as the sole Republican to vote to convict Trump in his impeachment trial. 
   
      Amid a call from another speaker at the breakfast to “love your enemies,” Trump said, “They like people and sometimes they hate people. I’m sorry. I apologize. I’m trying to learn. It’s not easy,” adding, “When they impeach you for nothing, then you’re supposed to like them. It’s not easy, folks. I do my best.” 
   
      And at his first appearance in 2017, Trump asked the room full of lawmakers, foreign dignitaries and religious leaders to “pray” for Arnold Schwarzenegger so that ratings of his show – NBC’s “The Apprentice” – would go up.
   
      Originally, the prayer breakfast was a far less formal affair. An organizer of the breakfast told CNN that the first breakfast was actually a small gathering of President Dwight Eisenhower and members on Capitol Hill after Eisenhower learned lawmakers were meeting regularly to pray. Eisenhower confided to a lawmaker at the time that he was lonely and that the White House seemed isolating. He asked if he could join the members in the exercise of faith.
   
      Today, lawmakers still meet regularly in religious fellowship: Every Wednesday, in session, senators meet for Bible study, and House members regularly meet on Thursdays. 
   
      One member who participates in them told CNN that they are some of the most important and intimate gatherings on Capitol Hill, an opportunity for members – who often are away from family and friends when they are in Washington – to share about their family, their faith and even the very human toll that the job can take. The gatherings are considered off the record, a safe space and one of the most important bastions of bipartisan dialogue that happens on Capitol Hill.

      New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft told CNN on Thursday that he wants Tom Brady to sign a one-day contract and officially retire as a Patriot.
   
      “Not only do I want it, our fans are clamoring for it,” Kraft said. “To us, he is always has been and always will be a Patriot.
   
      “We will do everything in our power to bring him back, have him sign off as a Patriot and find ways to honor him for many years to come.”
   
      Brady announced his retirement from the NFL on Wednesday. Of his record seven Super Bowl wins, six came with New England. Another followed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
   
      Kraft shared a story of Brady – selected at No. 199 overall in the 2000 NFL draft – when the young quarterback introduced himself near the end of training camp.
   
      The Patriots owner – who now tells CNN Brady should have been the top pick that year instead of going in the sixth round – said the future seven-time Super Bowl winner told him, “I’m the best decision your franchise has ever made.”
   
      “He was No. 4 in our depth chart,” Kraft said. “He came down, and he really believed what he said – and he was right.”
   
      The legendary quarterback announced his retirement after 23 seasons with a video message, where the 45-year-old confirmed he was “retiring for good.”
   
      He first retired in February 2022, but the decision proved temporary as he returned for one more season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
   
      Brady told his father, Tom Brady Sr., about a week ago that he was retiring, according to the elder Brady  in a phone interview with the Boston Globe on Wednesday.
   
      “We’re not shocked by any means,” Brady’s dad told the Globe. “He has played football for 32 years out of his 45, living his dream for three-fourths of his life. It’s been a wonderful ride. He’s very secure in his decision. It’s about time.”
   
      “This has been a hard year,” added Brady Sr. in the Globe interview. “I’m really happy for Tommy from the standpoint that he’s going to be able to spend more time with his kids.
   
      “He’s going out on his own terms, and he’s in good health. He’s taken a lot of hits over the years — a lot of sacks, a lot of knockdowns. I am thrilled that he won’t get knocked down again.”
   
      During his long career, three-time league MVP Brady has broken almost every passing record, including regular season passing yards (89,214) and passing touchdowns (649). He has also amassed the most wins of any player in NFL history (251).

      The number of times it’s appropriate to wear clothing items without washing them often seems based more on folklore or a person’s upbringing than professional advice.
   
      TikTok user Allison Delperdang started a heated online debate when she posted a video January 10 saying she wears the same pajamas multiple times. 
   
      “When I was younger my parents always made us wear pajamas … multiple nights in a row because they weren’t dirty, and I still do that as an adult,” she said. “I need to know if, like, as adults we’re still doing that, or should I be literally making dirty clothes every single night?”
   
      The answer — for pajamas as well as other clothes — technically depends on personal aspects such as sweat level and lifestyle, though for many people other, more abstract factors may come into play, experts say.
   
      Our beliefs about clothing hygiene are largely “societal and cultural,” said Dr. Anthony Rossi, an assistant attending dermatologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and a fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology. “People tend to over wash and ‘over hygiene’ themselves, because especially in America, we have a luxury of being able to do all that stuff all the time.” 
   
      Rewearing the same clothes — particularly on consecutive days — is “linked to avoiding decision fatigue, hence wearing the same clothes involves less decisions to make and less stress every morning,” said Manal Mohammed, senior lecturer of medical microbiology at the University of Westminster in London.
   
      Not knowing when to wash your clothes can have consequences on both ends of the spectrum. Washing them too seldom could lead to skin problems or infections, and washing them too often could harm your clothing. The latter can also result in unnecessary laundry and use of resources. 
   
      Here are some guiding principles to help you determine when a garment can be worn again without washing and when it’s time to toss it in the hamper. 
   
      There’s no hard and fast rule for how many times you can wear clothing again, but experts say there are a few types that should be washed after every use: underwear, socks, tights, leggings and activewear. This advice also applies to any other clothes with stains, sweat, odor or visible dirt, Mohammed said. 
   
      These kinds of clothes are “on a part of our body that just has a lot of natural bacteria that lives on our body, like our microbiome, (yeast) and bacteria,” Rossi said. “Then from day-to-day activities, we sweat. That just breeds moisture and an environment where this bacteria can overgrow.” 
   
      Bacteria overgrowth can lead to infections, fungus and other skin issues, he added. 
   
      In addition to bacteria from sweat, clothes worn in gyms or sports settings can come into contact with bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, resulting in infections common in community and hospital settings. Those infections can become serious if they enter internal tissues or the bloodstream.
   
      Some people might let their workout clothes dry via air or a dryer, intending to make them safe to wear again the next day. But that approach makes the situation worse, Rossi said. 
   
      “Heat is going to make the bacteria grow. It’s not hot enough to sterilize them,” he said. “It’s really the washing with soap and water (that you need) — and with hot water, especially, because it’s going to help loosen that dirt and sebum and really get rid of bacteria.” 
   
      When it comes to why you shouldn’t wear socks again without washing first, “fungal infections on the feet and toes are just rampant,” said dermatologist Dr. Jeremy Fenton, medical director for Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City and a clinical instructor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital. “Inside of our shoes is the perfect environment for breeding fungus. It’s warm, it’s humid, it’s dark.” 
   
      Because of that, you should wash your shoes or at least the insoles in a washing machine at least once per month, Rossi said. 
   
      For pajamas, outerwear, jeans and other clothes, how many times you can wear them without washing is based on the same principles for undergarments or activewear. 
   
      “As far as your pants and your shirts, I think it’s all a level of comfort and how much you’re perspiring throughout the day,” Rossi said. “A lot of people wear undershirts. The undershirt would be something to wash, whereas your top shirt you don’t really need to wash.” 
   
      If you don’t wear underwear, you need to wash your clothing before wearing it again since it came into contact with your genital skin, Rossi said. 
   
      If you usually shower before bed, wear underwear and sweat little to none when wearing pajamas, you could wear them for a week without washing, experts said. But if you don’t do these things, you’d need to wash them every time. 
   
      Outerwear — such as coats or jackets — typically doesn’t need to be washed more than once a month since it doesn’t touch your skin, Rossi said. “If you’re wearing it every day, probably (wash it) every two weeks,” he suggested. 
   
      Whether and how often to wash jeans can be a hot topic, since many people want to maintain the integrity of the fabric, which is usually stiffer and more durable than others. If jeans aren’t sweaty, dirty or stained, they don’t have to be washed often, Rossi said. “I personally don’t wash my jeans,” he added.
   
      Mohammed recommended washing jeans monthly but acknowledged it depends on your lifestyle and environment. 
   
      “If somebody were to tell me that they were wearing their jeans for months on end and not washing them and they hadn’t had any problems with their skin or problems with odor, I wouldn’t see any problem at all,” Fenton said. 
   
      The most important questions you should ask yourself, experts say, when considering whether to wear something again without washing are these: Does it smell? Do I have any skin conditions, such as eczema, a rash or a skin lesion? Is it visibly dirty? Is it sweaty? Did I wear underwear with this? 
   
      “The main point is that the answer is going to be very variable,” Fenton said.

      A Brazilian senator says former President Jair Bolsonaro attended a meeting in December to overturn Brazil’s 2022 presidential election results, which granted current leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva the presidency.
   
      Senator Marcos do Val said in a press conference on Thursday, that both he and Bolsonaro were present at a private discussion on December 9 organized by Bolsonaro ally and then-congressman Daniel Silveira. 
   
      According to do Val’s account, Silveira proposed a plan to discredit the recent election, suggesting that do Val arrange and secretly record a meeting with Electoral Court President and Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes.
   
      Do Val said he was told to prompt the judge to say things that would raise doubts about the vote’s validity and the electoral court’s neutrality.
   
      He also released screenshots of his WhatsApp messages with Silveira about the meeting and the plan.
   
      In describing Bolsonaro’s role in the conversation, do Val said the president remained silent on the proposal, and did not discourage it. He said he had the impression there was an agreement.
   
      Do Val said, “It was Daniel (Silveira) who spoke. I said I would think about it later and make contact.” 
   
      “It was very clear that he was in a position to manipulate and have (Bolsonaro) buy into his idea, if a senator accepted the mission,” do Val also said.
   
      Silveira’s legal team did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
   
      According to do Val, he ultimately did meet with de Moraes on December 14, but instead of recording the encounter, warned the judge about the plot. De Moraes has not commented publicly.  
   
      On Thursday, de Moraes, who is in charge of the ongoing probe on the January 8 riots, ordered do Val to give a deposition to Federal Police within five days, according to a Supreme Court document.
   
      Do Val also said that he was told by Silveira that the plan also involved Brazil’s Institutional Security Office (GSI), which is responsible for the president’s security. The GSI would provide secret agents and recording devices to Do Val. 
   
      Brazil’s Intelligence Agency, which commands the GSI, denied this on Thursday, saying it is “absolutely not involved in any initiative related to the possibility of recording conversations of ministers of the Federal Supreme Court.”
   
      Bolsonaro’s office did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Reacting to do Val’s claims during a Senate session on Thursday, the ex-President’s son, Sen. Flavio Bolsonaro, said, “clarifications need to be made so that narratives do not overcome the facts.”
   
      “The fact is that on December 31, President Bolsonaro left the presidency,” he added.
   
      Lula narrowly won the Brazilian presidency in a run-off vote in October, but many of Bolsonaro’s supporters have refused to accept the results, their defiance culminating in an attack on government buildings in Brasilia on January 8. 
   
      Bolsonaro himself did not publicly acknowledge the election results until December 30. 
   
      Silveira, a former police officer whose congressional term ended this week, was arrested on Thursday on unrelated charges, after he allegedly failed to comply with court orders and tampered with his electronic ankle monitor – the result of a 2021 conviction for anti-democratic acts.

      China’s southwestern province of Sichuan will drop restrictions on unmarried people having children, part of a broader attempt by the government to boost the country’s plummeting birth rate.
   
      The policy shift came after China’s population shrank last year for the first time in more than six decades, marking a historic moment in its deepening demographic crisis. 
   
      Currently, the Sichuan government only allows married couples to register the births of up to two children. Starting from February 15, all citizens – including unmarried parents – can register with no ceiling on the number of children. 
   
      In China, birth registration is often required for parents to access benefits such as maternity insurance. It is also needed to obtain a household registration document, or hukou, that grants children access to social welfare, such as healthcare and education.
   
      The Sichuan provincial health commission said in a statement that by scrapping the restriction on marriage, the new measures shifted the focus of birth registration to “the desire and results of childbearing.”
   
      An official from the commission told state media the policy was intended to protect the rights of single mothers, instead of encouraging unmarried people to become parents.
   
      The new rules will grant single parents in Sichuan access to benefits previously reserved for married couples, such as maternity insurance that covers prenatal healthcare, childbirth-related medical expenses and paid maternity leave.
   
      Sichuan, home to more than 83 million people, is the fifth most populous province in China.
   
      Its relaxation of birth registration requirements follow similar steps taken by other provinces, such as Guangdong and Shaanxi.
   
      China’s demographic crisis, which is expected to have an increasing impact on growth in the years to come, has been a key concern for policymakers.
   
      Beijing scrapped its decades-long and highly controversial “one child” policy in 2015, after realizing the restriction had contributed to a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce that could severely distress the country’s economic and social stability.
   
      To arrest the falling birth rate, the Chinese government announced in 2015 that it would allow married couples to have two children. But after a brief uptick in 2016, the national birth rate has continued to fall.
   
      Policymakers further relaxed limits on births in 2021, allowing three children, and ramped up efforts to encourage larger families, including through a multi-agency plan released last year to strengthen maternity leave and offer tax deductions and other perks to families. But those efforts have yet to see results amid changing gender norms, the high cost of living and education, and looming economic uncertainty.
   
      Many young people are choosing to marry later or deciding not to have children altogether.
