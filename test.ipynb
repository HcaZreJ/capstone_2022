    "For this function \"make_similarity_matrix(iterable)\", we can analyze its scaling behavior and see that it scales with $\\Theta(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of this \"iterable\" in its input. This is because the function utilizes two for loops that first goes over all of the items once in the iterable, then for each item it goes over all of the items in the iterable a second time, to compute a cosine similarity score between every pair of items in the iterable. Computing the cosine similarity score might also be costly if the vectors in the iterable are of a large size, but that would only be multiplying a constant on top of the $n^2$ complexity (given that $n$ is large and it is since we are analyzing the function's asymptotic behavior, i.e., when $n$ is large), which justifies our analysis of its scaling behavior being $\\Theta(n^2)$. The Big-$\\Theta$ notation is the better one to be used here, because there is no conditional statement in the for loops that gives us a better case or a worst case, which makes describing its scaling behavior using the average case $\\Theta$ the best choice. This complexity of this function could be improved if conditional statements were included in the two for loops to avoid repeatedly calculating the same score again, since the cosine similarity score between two vectors does not change when their order is reversed, additionally the cosine similarity score between two identical vectors is just 1. This is not done in this iteration of the product since this is just the first draft, but in future iterations in order to minimize the time taken for this operation, this improvement will likely be implemented, which should improve the complexity of this function to $\\Theta(n^2/2-n)$, with the division by 2 due to removing all the duplicate calculations, and minus $n$ due to simply equating all the calculation between identical vectors to be 1."

       "'China has recorded its highest number of daily Covid cases since the pandemic began, despite stringent measures designed to eliminate the virus. Several major cities including the capital Beijing and southern trade hub Guangzhou are experiencing outbreaks. Wednesday saw 31,527 cases recorded compared with an April peak of 28,000. The numbers are still tiny for a country of 1.4 billion people and officially just over 5,200 have died since the pandemic began. That equates to three Covid deaths in every million in China, compared with 3,000 per million in the US and 2,400 per million in the UK, although direct comparisons between countries are difficult. While China\\'s zero-Covid policy has clearly saved lives, it has also dealt a punishing blow to the economy and ordinary people\\'s lives. The country slightly relaxed some of those restrictions a few weeks ago.  It cut quarantine for close contacts from seven days in a state facility to five days and three days at home, and stopped recording secondary contacts which allowed many more people to avoid having to quarantine. Officials have also sought to avoid enforcing blanket lockdowns of the kind endured by the largest city, Shanghai, earlier this year. But faced with a renewed surge in cases in Beijing, as well as the first deaths from the virus in months, officials have already implemented some restrictions in several districts, with shops, schools and restaurants closed. The central city of Zhengzhou is also to enforce an effective lockdown for 6 million residents from Friday, officials announced. It follows violent protests at a vast industrial complex belonging to iPhone manufacturer Foxconn. The firm has apologised for a \"technical error\" in its payment systems. This video can not be played WATCH: Chinese protesters clash with riot police at giant iPhone factory Other stories of suffering and desperation have been shared online where they have fuelled public resentment. Last week, reports that a baby in Zhengzhou died because her medical care was delayed by Covid restrictions prompted a huge outcry. Among some of the most severe responses to Covid this year: The word came suddenly last night that our housing compound would be locked down with all residents confined to their homes. This is not a surprise in China anymore. At any point, a single infection or being linked to an infection can mean not being allowed out. Beijing is in the middle of a major Covid outbreak but, even before then, visiting a shopping mall or a building where an infected person had been meant going into home quarantine. Right now, in the capital\\'s vast Chaoyang district most businesses are closed. In thousands of tower blocks, all residents have been ordered to remain indoors for the next few days initially. Then consider that this is being replicated in cities right across the country. In the regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, the lockdowns have gone on for months. At the beginning of 2023, this country will be heading into its fourth year of this crisis and, whether it is true or not, zero-Covid has a never-ending feeling to it. People are completely worn out by the pandemic and the government\\'s economy-destroying response to it. That officials have not explained where the off ramp is, has only added to the uncertainty. Scientists here can also see that China\\'s vaccination rates are way too low, especially amongst vulnerable groups. What is more, not enough resources have been diverted into expanding medical facilities to cope with a massive influx of patients following any opening-up. In the short term though, my compound has now told me that, after several rounds of mass testing, we are allowed to leave. For most residents this will not make much difference though because hardly anything outside is open, including their workplaces. China is the last major economy still pursuing a Covid eradication process with mass testing and lockdown rules, and virus cases are being recorded in 31 provinces. Part of the reason is that vaccination levels are lower than in other developed nations, and only half of people aged over 80 have their primary vaccinations. China has refused to import vaccines despite evidence that its homemade jabs have not proved as effective. President Xi Jinping argues that strict curbs are needed to protect the country\\'s large elderly population. Zero-Covid has come to define his rule and the authoritarian bureaucracy at his disposal like almost no other policy. It projects a veneer of control and stability in the run-up to March when China\\'s equivalent of a parliament will convene to choose Mr Xi as president for a third time. \"Lockdowns prevent Covid outbreaks from spreading,\" William Hurst, professor of Chinese development at Cambridge University, told BBC News recently. \"But they also exert incredibly strict social control.\" Â© 2022 BBC.

    "The above results are reasonable and expected, since I gave two ratings of 9 to two Ukrainian war news articles, and two 8s and one 7 to three other political articles (if you want to check out the articles out themselves, you can run all of the above code cells, it should output the same data), and the most similar piece of text that the model recommends is also about the Ukrainian war. It makes perfect sense for the recommender to be recommending news articles about the Ukrainian war, after it sees that I am interested in the Ukranian war and politics. This is defintely not the ideal version of the recommender that we want, since we want it to be able to extrapolate our preference and recommend thing that we do not know we are interested in.\n",

    "I have thought about a few interesting applications that might strength this current Word2Vec model, and I will be testing one of them out in the next iteration of the product. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instead of recommending articles that has the closest similarity to the learned user's preference, we always attempt to recommend articles that are a given distance away from the user's preference. In other words, if we were to think of the endpoint of the vector of user's preference as a point in a high-dimensional word-embedding space, we always attempt to recommend articles that is on the surface of a hyper-sphere that has its center as the preference of the user. With every news article that we recommend to the user, instead of asking for the user to score their satisfaction, we ask the user whether this is too convergent to their ideas (by which we move the center of the hyper-sphere away from this point), or too divergent to their ideas (by which we move the center of the hyper-sphere closer to this point); and whether they would like more convergent new (by which we decrease the radius of the hyper-sphere), or they would like more divergent news (by which we then increase the radius of the hyper-sphere).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The limitation of the above method is that it allows users to create their own \"media bubble\". Stubborn people only gets more stubborn. A potential improvement to the model is if we do not allow the user to control that. In addition, we include some randomness into the model prediction, by adding a random vector of a set magnitude on top of the learned user's preference every time we are generating a news recommendation, that is to say, instead of recommending news articles that are the most similar to the preference of the user, we recommend news articles that are always a set semantic distance away from the preference of the user (in a random direction). Obviously, the limitation of this method is that the setting of the magnitude of the random vector becomes very influential in the recommendation process."
